@Component: This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean. Spring will automatically detect classes annotated with @Component and create a bean instance for each of them.

@Service: This annotation is a specialization of @Component and is used to mark a class as a service layer component in Spring.

@Repository: This annotation is also a specialization of @Component and is used to mark a class as a data access component in Spring.

@Autowired: This annotation is used to inject a dependency into a Spring-managed bean. Spring will look for a bean of the required type and inject it into the field or constructor parameter annotated with @Autowired.

@Qualifier: This annotation is used in conjunction with @Autowired to specify which bean should be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type. You can use @Qualifier to provide a unique name for the bean to be injected.

@Value: This annotation is used to inject a value into a Spring-managed bean, such as a property or a constructor argument.

@Configuration: This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring configuration class. Spring will use the beans defined in a configuration class to create the application context.

@Bean: This annotation is used to define a bean in a Spring configuration class. You can use @Bean to define a custom bean or to override a bean defined in a third-party library.

@ComponentScan: This annotation is used to specify which packages Spring should scan for components and beans. Spring will search for classes annotated with @Component or its specializations in the specified packages and create bean instances for each of them.

@Scope: This annotation is used to specify the scope of a bean. You can use @Scope to create singleton, prototype, session, or request-scoped beans.

@Lazy: This annotation is used to delay the initialization of a bean until it is actually needed. You can use @Lazy to reduce the startup time of an application by avoiding the creation of beans that are not immediately required.

@Primary: This annotation is used to indicate which bean should be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type. The bean annotated with @Primary will be used by default.

@Conditional: This annotation is used to conditionally create a bean based on the presence or absence of certain conditions. You can use @Conditional to create beans only if certain conditions are met.

@RequestMapping: This annotation is used to map a URL request to a method in a Spring controller class. You can use @RequestMapping to specify the URL path, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and more.

@PathVariable: This annotation is used to extract a variable from the URL path and use it as a method parameter in a Spring controller class. You can use @PathVariable to retrieve path variables from the URL.

@RequestParam: This annotation is used to retrieve request parameters from the URL or request body and use them as method parameters in a Spring controller class. You can use @RequestParam to retrieve query parameters or form data.

@RequestBody: This annotation is used to retrieve the request body as an object and use it as a method parameter in a Spring controller class. You can use @RequestBody to handle JSON or XML request bodies.

@ResponseStatus: This annotation is used to set the HTTP response status code for a method in a Spring controller class.
