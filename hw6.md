### Q1: Explain volatile variables in java? (we also use it in Singleton)



In Java, a variable can be declared as volatile if it is subject to concurrent modification by multiple threads. The volatile keyword is used to ensure that the value of the variable is always read from and written to the main memory, rather than a thread's local cache.

When a variable is declared as volatile, any write operation on that variable is immediately visible to all threads that access it. This ensures that there is no inconsistency in the value of the variable due to different threads accessing different copies of it.

In the context of the Singleton pattern, the use of volatile variables ensures that the Singleton instance is properly initialized in a multithreaded environment. When a volatile variable is used to store the Singleton instance, any updates to the instance are immediately visible to all threads. This ensures that all threads always see the same instance of the Singleton, even in a multithreaded environment.

Note that while the use of volatile variables can help ensure thread-safety, it does not guarantee it. Synchronization or other thread-safety mechanisms may still be necessary in some cases to ensure proper access to shared resources.

### Q2: how to create a new thread(Please also consider Thread Pool case)?

Extending the Thread class
Implementing the Runnable interface
Use ExecutorService to create TreadPool.


### Q3: Difference between Runnable and Callable?

1.  Return value: The Runnable interface has a void run() method, which does not return a value. The Callable interface, on the other hand, has a V call() method, which returns a value of type V.

2.  Exception handling: The run() method of the Runnable interface does not throw any checked exceptions, so any exceptions that occur must be caught and handled within the task itself. The call() method of the Callable interface can throw an Exception, which must be caught and handled by the calling code.

3.  Generic type: The Callable interface is parameterized with a generic type that specifies the type of value returned by the call() method. The Runnable interface does not have a generic type parameter.

### Q4: what is the diff between t.start() and t.run()?

In Java, the `Thread` class provides two methods for starting a new thread: `start()` and `run()`. The main difference between the two is that `start()` creates a new thread of execution and calls the `run()` method of the `Thread` object in the new thread, while `run()` executes the code in the current thread of execution.

### Q5: Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?

In Java, you can create threads either by extending the `Thread` class or by implementing the `Runnable` interface. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.

Extending the `Thread` class is simpler and more straightforward, as you can directly override the `run()` method to define the code that will be executed in the new thread. However, this approach has the drawback of not allowing you to extend any other class, since Java does not support multiple inheritance.

On the other hand, implementing the `Runnable` interface allows you to separate the thread code from the thread itself, which can be useful if you need to reuse the same code in multiple threads or want to make your code more modular. This approach also enables you to extend another class or implement another interface, as you are not limited to extending the `Thread` class.

Overall, it is generally recommended to implement the `Runnable` interface instead of extending the `Thread` class, as it offers more flexibility and better encapsulation of code. It also allows you to use the same code in different contexts, such as in a thread pool or with an executor service.

### Q6: what is the thread status?

In Java, a thread can be in one of several possible states at any given time, which are represented by the `Thread.State` enumeration. The possible states are:

1.  `NEW`: The thread has been created but has not yet started running.
2.  `RUNNABLE`: The thread is executing or is ready to execute, but may be waiting for resources such as CPU time or I/O operations to complete.
3.  `BLOCKED`: The thread is waiting for a monitor lock to be released in order to enter a synchronized block or method.
4.  `WAITING`: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action, such as notifying it or interrupting it.
5.  `TIMED_WAITING`: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action, but with a timeout specified, after which it will automatically resume execution.
6.  `TERMINATED`: The thread has completed execution and has terminated.

### Q7: difference between wait() and sleep() method

The `wait()` and `sleep()` methods are both used for pausing the execution of a thread in Java, but they serve different purposes and behave differently.

The `wait()` method is used to temporarily suspend the execution of a thread until another thread notifies it to wake up. When a thread calls the `wait()` method on an object, it releases the monitor on that object and enters a waiting state until another thread calls the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method on the same object. The `wait()` method must be called inside a synchronized block or method, otherwise it will throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

### Q8: What is deadlock?

Deadlock is a situation in multi-threaded programming where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release the resources they need to continue execution. In other words, each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs to proceed, creating a situation where neither thread can make progress.

Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are competing for resources such as locks, semaphores, or other shared objects, and each thread holds onto one or more resources while waiting for the others to release their resources. If the threads are not carefully synchronized, this can lead to a situation where they become deadlocked, and no thread can continue its execution.

### Q9: how do threads communicate with each other?

Threads can communicate with each other through shared objects, such as variables or data structures, or through synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and monitors.

One common way for threads to communicate is through shared objects. Threads can read and modify shared objects, and use them to exchange information or coordinate their activities. However, care must be taken to ensure that shared objects are accessed in a thread-safe manner, to avoid race conditions or other synchronization issues.

Another way for threads to communicate is through synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and monitors. These mechanisms allow threads to coordinate their activities and enforce mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. For example, a lock can be used to ensure that only one thread can modify a shared object at a time, while other threads wait for the lock to be released.

Thread communication can also be achieved through higher-level synchronization mechanisms such as message passing or event-driven programming. In message passing, threads send messages to each other through a shared message queue, while in event-driven programming, threads receive and respond to events triggered by other threads or external stimuli.

Overall, thread communication requires careful synchronization and coordination to ensure that threads can safely exchange information and avoid synchronization issues such as race conditions or deadlocks.

### Q10: what is join() method?

`join()` is a method in Java that allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread before continuing its own execution. When a thread calls `join()` on another thread, it will block until that thread completes its execution and terminates.

### Q11: what is yield() method

`yield()` is a method in Java that is used to pause the currently executing thread and give other threads of the same priority the chance to run. When a thread calls `yield()`, it voluntarily gives up its current time slice, allowing other threads to run instead.

### Q12: Explain thread pool

A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads that are ready to be used for executing tasks. The purpose of a thread pool is to improve the performance and scalability of concurrent applications by avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task.

In a thread pool, a fixed number of worker threads are created and maintained by the pool. Tasks are submitted to the pool, and each task is executed by one of the available threads. When a task is completed, the thread returns to the pool, ready to be used for another task. This allows the application to reuse threads and avoid the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task, which can be a significant performance bottleneck in highly concurrent applications.

Thread pools typically use a queue to hold incoming tasks until a worker thread is available to execute them. The queue can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as a blocking queue or a priority queue, depending on the requirements of the application.

One advantage of using a thread pool is that it provides a way to limit the number of threads that are created and used by an application, which can help prevent resource exhaustion and improve overall system stability. Thread pools can also be configured to control the behavior of threads, such as their priority, affinity, or maximum execution time, depending on the requirements of the application.

In Java, thread pools are commonly implemented using the `Executor` framework, which provides a high-level API for creating and managing thread pools. The `Executor` framework includes several built-in implementations of thread pools, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`, as well as a variety of helper classes for submitting tasks and managing thread pools.

### Q13:  What is Executor Framework in Java, its different types and how to create these  executors?

The Executor Framework in Java is a high-level API for creating and managing threads and thread pools. It provides a way to abstract away the details of thread creation and management, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications.

The Executor Framework includes several built-in implementations of thread pools, as well as a variety of helper classes for submitting tasks and managing thread pools. Here are some of the different types of executors available in the framework:

1.  `ThreadPoolExecutor`: This is the most basic type of executor and provides a fixed-size thread pool. The number of threads in the pool is specified at creation time, and each thread executes tasks from a shared queue.

2.  `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`: This type of executor provides a fixed-size thread pool for executing tasks at specified intervals. It is often used for scheduling periodic tasks, such as background jobs or maintenance tasks.

3.  `SingleThreadExecutor`: This type of executor provides a single thread for executing tasks sequentially. It is often used for tasks that require exclusive access to a shared resource or for executing tasks in a specific order.

4.  `CachedThreadPool`: This type of executor creates new threads as needed and reuses threads that are idle. It is often used for executing short-lived tasks or for handling bursts of activity.

### Q14: Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor



Both `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` methods are used to stop the execution of tasks submitted to an `ExecutorService`. However, there are some differences between them:

1. `shutdown()` method:

The `shutdown()` method initiates a graceful shutdown of the `ExecutorService`. This means that it will not immediately stop all the running tasks. Instead, it will stop accepting new tasks and wait for the already submitted tasks to complete their execution. Once all the tasks are completed, the `ExecutorService` will be terminated.

2. `shutdownNow()` method:

The `shutdownNow()` method forcefully shuts down the `ExecutorService`. It will immediately stop all the running tasks and will attempt to interrupt the threads executing the tasks. It returns a list of tasks that were submitted but not started, and a list of tasks that were submitted and are still executing.

In summary, the main difference between `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` methods is that the former initiates a graceful shutdown, allowing the submitted tasks to complete their execution, while the latter forces an immediate shutdown, interrupting the executing tasks.

### Q15: What is Atomic classes? when do we use it?

In Java, atomic classes are classes that provide thread-safe operations on a single value without the need for explicit synchronization. They are located in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package and are typically used in multi-threaded applications to ensure that the access to shared variables is performed in a thread-safe manner, without the need for explicit synchronization using locks or other mechanisms.

The atomic classes provide a set of operations that are guaranteed to be atomic and therefore, ensure that no two threads can interfere with each other's access to the shared variable. These operations include:

1. `get()` and `set()` methods: These methods are used to retrieve or update the current value of the variable.

2. `compareAndSet()` method: This method compares the current value of the variable with an expected value and updates the variable to a new value if and only if the current value matches the expected value. This operation is performed atomically, meaning that no other thread can modify the variable in the meantime.

3. Other atomic operations such as `incrementAndGet()`, `getAndIncrement()`, `decrementAndGet()`, `getAndDecrement()`, and `getAndSet()`, which perform simple arithmetic operations atomically.

Atomic classes are typically used in situations where multiple threads need to access and modify a shared variable, and where performance is critical. Examples of such scenarios include:

1. Counters or accumulators that are accessed by multiple threads concurrently.

2. Shared variables that represent the state of a system or a resource.

3. Variables used for synchronization or coordination between multiple threads.

In summary, atomic classes provide a convenient way to ensure thread-safety when accessing and modifying shared variables in a multi-threaded environment, without the need for explicit synchronization using locks or other mechanisms.

### Q16: What is the cocurrent collections?

In Java, concurrent collections are thread-safe collections that allow multiple threads to access and modify their contents concurrently, without the need for explicit synchronization. They are located in the `java.util.concurrent` package and are designed to be used in multi-threaded applications where multiple threads may need to access or modify the same collection at the same time.

Concurrent collections provide several advantages over traditional non-concurrent collections, including:

1. Thread-safety: Concurrent collections are designed to be thread-safe, which means that they can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads concurrently, without the need for explicit synchronization using locks or other mechanisms.

2. High-performance: Concurrent collections are optimized for high concurrency and are typically more efficient than traditional non-concurrent collections when used in multi-threaded applications.

3. Scalability: Concurrent collections can scale well to support a large number of threads, making them suitable for use in high-concurrency applications.

Some of the commonly used concurrent collections in Java include:

1. `ConcurrentHashMap`: A thread-safe implementation of the `Map` interface that allows multiple threads to read and modify the map concurrently.

2. `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`: A thread-safe implementation of the `Queue` interface that allows multiple threads to add or remove elements from the queue concurrently.

3. `CopyOnWriteArrayList`: A thread-safe implementation of the `List` interface that provides a snapshot-style iterator, which does not throw `ConcurrentModificationException` even when the list is modified concurrently.

4. `BlockingQueue`: An interface that extends the `Queue` interface to provide additional blocking operations that wait for elements to become available or for space to become available in the queue.

In summary, concurrent collections are thread-safe collections that allow multiple threads to access and modify their contents concurrently, without the need for explicit synchronization. They provide several advantages over traditional non-concurrent collections, including thread-safety, high-performance, and scalability.

### Q17: what kind of locks you know?

In Java, locks are mechanisms used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. They are used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions and other synchronization problems. There are several types of locks available in Java, including:

1. `synchronized` keyword: The `synchronized` keyword is the most basic type of lock in Java. It is used to synchronize access to a block of code or an object, ensuring that only one thread can execute the synchronized block at a time.

2. Reentrant Lock: The `ReentrantLock` class is a more advanced type of lock that allows multiple locks to be acquired and released in a reentrant manner. This means that a thread can acquire the same lock multiple times without blocking, as long as it releases the lock the same number of times.

3. ReadWriteLock: The `ReadWriteLock` interface provides a way to implement locks that allow multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently, while allowing only one thread to write to the resource at a time.

4. StampedLock: The `StampedLock` class is a more advanced type of lock that provides optimistic locking, which can be faster than traditional locking in some scenarios.

5. Semaphore: The `Semaphore` class is a type of lock that allows a limited number of threads to access a shared resource concurrently. It maintains a set of permits that must be acquired before a thread can access the resource.

6. CountDownLatch: The `CountDownLatch` class is a type of lock that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations is completed before continuing their execution.

In summary, locks are used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. There are several types of locks available in Java, including `synchronized`, Reentrant Lock, ReadWriteLock, StampedLock, Semaphore, and CountDownLatch. Each type of lock has its own characteristics and is suitable for different types of synchronization scenarios.

### Q18: What is the difference between class lock and object lock?

In Java, the terms "class lock" and "object lock" are often used to refer to two different types of locks: `synchronized` blocks that are synchronized on a class-level and those that are synchronized on an object-level.

A class-level lock is obtained by synchronizing a static method or a `synchronized` block that is synchronized on the `Class` object of the class. When a thread enters a class-level synchronized block, it obtains a lock on the class object, which prevents any other thread from entering any other class-level synchronized block of the same class until the lock is released. Class-level locks are used to ensure that only one thread can access a class-level resource at a time.

On the other hand, an object-level lock is obtained by synchronizing a non-static method or a `synchronized` block that is synchronized on a specific object instance. When a thread enters an object-level synchronized block, it obtains a lock on the object instance, which prevents any other thread from entering any other object-level synchronized block that synchronizes on the same object instance until the lock is released. Object-level locks are used to ensure that only one thread can access an object-level resource at a time.

The main difference between class-level and object-level locks is the scope of the lock. Class-level locks are scoped to the entire class, while object-level locks are scoped to individual object instances. This means that class-level locks are used to control access to class-level resources, while object-level locks are used to control access to object-level resources.

In summary, the main difference between class-level and object-level locks in Java is the scope of the lock. Class-level locks are scoped to the entire class, while object-level locks are scoped to individual object instances. Class-level locks are used to control access to class-level resources, while object-level locks are used to control access to object-level resources.

### Q19: What is future and completableFuture?

In Java, `Future` and `CompletableFuture` are two classes that are used for asynchronous programming and managing concurrent computations.

A `Future` is a class that represents a computation that may not have completed yet. It provides methods for checking if the computation is done, waiting for the computation to complete, and retrieving the result of the computation. `Future` is used to retrieve the result of an asynchronous computation, which may be executed by a separate thread or a different process. It is often used in conjunction with `Executor` to submit tasks for execution and retrieve the result at a later time.

A `CompletableFuture` is a more advanced class that provides additional features and flexibility for asynchronous programming. It represents a computation that can be completed asynchronously and provides a wide range of methods for composing, combining, and manipulating asynchronous computations. `CompletableFuture` allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in a more concise and flexible way than using `Future` and `Executor` directly. It supports many of the same features as `Future`, such as waiting for a computation to complete and retrieving the result, but also allows you to handle exceptions, specify timeouts, and compose multiple computations together in a more expressive way.

One of the key differences between `Future` and `CompletableFuture` is that `CompletableFuture` is more flexible and can be used to compose multiple asynchronous operations together in a more expressive way. Additionally, `CompletableFuture` provides methods for handling exceptions and specifying timeouts, which can be useful in complex asynchronous scenarios.

In summary, `Future` and `CompletableFuture` are classes in Java that are used for managing asynchronous computations. `Future` is a basic class for retrieving the result of an asynchronous computation, while `CompletableFuture` is a more advanced class that provides additional features and flexibility for composing and manipulating asynchronous computations.

### Q20: what is ThreadLocal?

In Java, `ThreadLocal` is a class that allows you to create thread-local variables. A thread-local variable is a variable that is local to a specific thread and is not shared among multiple threads. Each thread has its own copy of the variable, and changes to the variable in one thread do not affect its value in other threads.

`ThreadLocal` is commonly used in multithreaded programs where you need to store thread-specific data. For example, if you have a pool of database connections and you want to ensure that each thread gets its own connection, you can use `ThreadLocal` to store a separate connection object for each thread.
