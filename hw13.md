### Q2. what is selenium(YouTube)?

Selenium allows developers and testers to automate web application testing across different browsers and platforms. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable interaction with web elements, simulating user actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through web pages. With Selenium, you can write scripts in various programming languages, such as Java, Python, C#, and Ruby.


### Q3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
Cucumber is a testing tool and a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that helps bridge the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams. It allows collaboration among different roles involved in software development, such as business analysts, developers, testers, and stakeholders.

At its core, Cucumber enables the creation and execution of automated acceptance tests written in a human-readable format. These tests are known as "feature files" or "Gherkin files" and use a simple, structured language called Gherkin. Gherkin uses plain-text specifications with keywords to describe the desired behavior of an application or system.

The Gherkin syntax consists of three main components:

1. **Feature**: Describes a high-level business feature or functionality of the system.
2. **Scenario**: Represents a specific test scenario or test case within the feature, outlining a particular behavior.
3. **Steps**: These are the individual steps that make up the scenario. Each step begins with a keyword such as Given, When, Then, And, or But.

Cucumber supports various programming languages, including Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and more. By combining Cucumber with a programming language, developers can implement the automation logic behind the steps defined in the feature files.

When executed, Cucumber interprets the feature files and matches the steps with the corresponding automation code. It then generates readable reports that indicate which steps have passed or failed, providing feedback on the application's behavior and overall test coverage.

Cucumber promotes collaboration and communication between team members by providing a common language that can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It helps ensure that the software being developed aligns with the intended business requirements and user expectations.

It's worth noting that my information about Cucumber is based on its usage and features as of September 2021, and there may have been updates or new developments since then.
### Q4. what is JMeter(youtube)?

Apache JMeter, commonly referred to as JMeter, is an open-source performance testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used for load testing, functional testing, and measuring the performance of web applications and services.

JMeter allows testers to simulate realistic user load on a target application or server to assess its performance under different scenarios. It can generate a large number of virtual users, also known as threads, to simulate concurrent user activity. These virtual users can send requests to the target application, mimicking actions such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, or downloading files.

Key features of JMeter include:

1. **Test Plan**: JMeter organizes test scenarios and configurations into a hierarchical structure called a "Test Plan." It provides flexibility in defining the test scenarios, including configuring thread groups, samplers, timers, and assertions.

2. **Thread Groups**: Thread Groups define the behavior of virtual users, including the number of threads, ramp-up time, and loop count. They simulate different user loads and concurrency levels.

3. **Samplers**: JMeter supports various samplers to mimic different types of requests, such as HTTP requests, FTP requests, JDBC database requests, and more. These samplers allow you to interact with the target system and measure its response time.

4. **Listeners**: JMeter provides listeners to capture and analyze test results. They generate reports, graphs, and tables that display metrics like response time, throughput, error rate, and other performance indicators.

5. **Assertions**: Assertions in JMeter validate the responses received from the target system against expected criteria. They help identify errors or discrepancies in the application's behavior during the test.

6. **Plugins and Extensibility**: JMeter supports a wide range of plugins that extend its functionality. These plugins provide additional capabilities, such as generating realistic test data, integrating with external systems, and enhancing reporting options.

JMeter can be run in a distributed mode, where multiple JMeter instances work together to generate a higher load and distribute the testing across different machines. This helps simulate real-world scenarios with a significant number of concurrent users.

While JMeter is primarily used for performance testing, it can also be utilized for functional testing, API testing, and other types of non-GUI-based testing.

Please note that my knowledge about JMeter is based on information available up until September 2021, and there may have been updates or new features introduced since then.
### Q5. what is unit-test?
A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to verify their correctness. The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, behaves as expected and produces the desired output given a specific input.

Key characteristics of unit tests include:

1. **Isolation**: Unit tests are designed to be independent of other units or external dependencies. They are isolated to focus solely on the behavior of the specific unit being tested. Any dependencies are typically mocked or replaced with test doubles to maintain isolation.

2. **Automated**: Unit tests are typically automated to allow for easy and frequent execution. Automated unit tests can be run repeatedly during development, ensuring that changes or additions to code do not introduce regressions or unexpected behavior.

3. **Small scope**: Unit tests are targeted at small units of code, such as individual functions, methods, or classes. By testing small units in isolation, it becomes easier to identify and pinpoint issues when they occur.

4. **Fast execution**: Unit tests are expected to execute quickly, allowing for rapid feedback during development. Fast execution enables developers to run tests frequently and receive immediate feedback on code changes.

Unit tests are written by developers themselves as part of the software development process. They are typically written using testing frameworks and libraries specific to the programming language being used. These frameworks provide the necessary tools and utilities to define test cases, execute tests, and assert expected outcomes.

Benefits of unit testing include:

- Early bug detection: Unit tests help identify issues at an early stage, allowing developers to fix them promptly before they propagate into more complex parts of the system.
- Code maintainability: Well-designed unit tests serve as documentation and can make code more maintainable. They provide examples of how the code should be used and allow developers to refactor or modify code with confidence.
- Regression prevention: Unit tests act as a safety net when making changes to code. They provide reassurance that existing functionality continues to work as intended after modifications are made.
- Design improvement: The act of writing unit tests often encourages developers to write code with testability in mind, leading to improved software design and modular architecture.

Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development and is often integrated into development workflows, such as test-driven development (TDD) or continuous integration (CI), to ensure the quality and reliability of software systems.
### Q6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
JUnit, one of the most widely used unit testing frameworks for Java, follows a specific lifecycle for executing tests. The lifecycle of JUnit involves several stages that determine the order and execution of various methods and annotations. Here is a general overview of the JUnit test lifecycle:

1. **Test class instantiation**: JUnit creates an instance of the test class before executing any test methods. This is done to ensure that each test method runs in an isolated environment.

2. **BeforeClass**: This is a static method annotated with `@BeforeClass`. It is executed once before any test method in the test class. It is commonly used for setting up resources or performing expensive initialization tasks that are shared among test methods.

3. **Test setup**: JUnit provides a method annotated with `@Before` that is executed before each test method. This method is used for preparing the test environment, initializing objects, and setting up any necessary test data.

4. **Test execution**: Each test method annotated with `@Test` is executed individually and independently of other test methods. These methods contain the actual test code, where assertions are made to validate the behavior of the unit under test.

5. **Test teardown**: JUnit provides a method annotated with `@After` that is executed after each test method. This method is used for cleaning up resources, releasing acquired objects, or performing any necessary post-test cleanup.

6. **AfterClass**: This is a static method annotated with `@AfterClass` that is executed once after all test methods have been executed. It is commonly used for releasing shared resources or performing final cleanup tasks.

It's important to note that the order of execution within a test class is not guaranteed. Each test method should be independent of others and not rely on the execution order. If specific ordering is required, you can use additional annotations such as `@FixMethodOrder` to define a fixed order for test methods.

JUnit also provides additional annotations and features for handling exceptions, parameterized tests, test suites, and more, allowing developers to customize and extend the test lifecycle according to their needs.

Keep in mind that this overview is based on JUnit 4, which was widely used at the time of my last knowledge update in September 2021. Since then, JUnit 5 has been released with significant changes and enhancements to the framework. The lifecycle and annotations may differ in JUnit 5, so it's advisable to consult the official JUnit documentation for the specific version you are using.

### Q7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Yes, in JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter), the `@BeforeAll` method should be declared at the class level and marked as `static`. The `@BeforeAll` annotation is used to denote a method that should be executed once before all test methods in the test class.

In JUnit 5, the lifecycle annotations `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` are used with static methods instead of instance methods, as was the case in JUnit 4. By using static methods, JUnit ensures that the methods are executed only once for the entire test class, regardless of the number of instances created.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `@BeforeAll` in JUnit 5:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MyTestClass {

    @BeforeAll
    static void setup() {
        // Perform one-time setup tasks for the test class
        // This method is executed only once before any test method
    }

    @Test
    void testMethod1() {
        // Test method 1
        assertEquals(2, 1 + 1);
    }

    @Test
    void testMethod2() {
        // Test method 2
        assertEquals(4, 2 * 2);
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `setup()` method annotated with `@BeforeAll` is declared as `static`. It will be executed once before any of the test methods (`testMethod1()` and `testMethod2()`) are executed.

It's worth noting that the `@BeforeAll` method should have a `void` return type and should not accept any parameters. Additionally, it should be defined in a public or default-access test class.

Make sure to use the correct JUnit version and consult the official JUnit documentation for the specific version you are using, as there may be differences in annotation names and behaviors between JUnit 4 and JUnit 5.

### Q8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

Mockito is a popular Java framework used for creating mock objects in unit tests. It provides a simple and intuitive API for mocking dependencies, stubbing method calls, and verifying interactions between objects.

The main purpose of Mockito is to facilitate the testing of a class or component in isolation by replacing its dependencies with mock objects. Mock objects are dummy implementations of interfaces or classes that simulate the behavior of the real objects they represent. They allow developers to control the responses of the mocked dependencies and verify the interactions between the tested object and its dependencies.

Some key features and capabilities of Mockito include:

1. **Mocking**: Mockito allows you to create mock objects using a concise API. These mock objects can be customized to specify the behavior of methods, return specific values, throw exceptions, or verify method invocations.

2. **Stubbing**: Mockito allows you to stub method calls on mock objects, defining specific return values or behaviors when certain methods are invoked.

3. **Verification**: Mockito provides methods to verify that specific methods on mock objects have been called with the expected arguments. This enables assertions on the interactions between objects during testing.

4. **Annotations**: Mockito supports annotations such as `@Mock`, `@Spy`, `@InjectMocks`, and `@Captor` to simplify the creation and injection of mock objects in test classes.

While Mockito is a powerful and widely used framework for mocking in Java, it does have some limitations to keep in mind:

1. **Final classes and methods**: Mockito cannot mock final classes or final methods due to Java language restrictions. If the class or method you want to mock is final, you may need to use other techniques, such as extending the class or using other mocking frameworks that can handle final members.

2. **Static methods**: Mockito cannot mock static methods. Similar to final classes or methods, mocking static methods requires using alternative approaches, such as using PowerMock or refactoring the code to make it more testable.

3. **Private methods**: Mockito cannot directly mock private methods. It focuses on testing the public API of classes. Private methods are generally considered implementation details and are not directly tested using Mockito. However, they can be indirectly tested by verifying the behavior of public methods that invoke the private methods.

4. **Overusing mocks**: Mocking too many dependencies or mocking objects that are tightly coupled can lead to brittle tests and make them less valuable. It's important to strike a balance and determine the appropriate level of mocking based on the needs of the specific test.

Despite these limitations, Mockito remains a powerful and widely used mocking framework in the Java ecosystem, providing a flexible and intuitive API for creating mock objects and verifying interactions in unit tests.

### Q9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
In the context of the Mockito framework for Java, `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` are annotations used to facilitate the creation and injection of mock objects in unit tests.

1. **@Mock**: The `@Mock` annotation is used to mark a field or parameter as a mock object. When this annotation is applied, Mockito will automatically create a mock object of the corresponding type.

Here's an example usage of `@Mock`:

```java
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyTestClass {

    @Mock
    private MyDependency mockedDependency;

    @Test
    void myTest() {
        // Use the mockedDependency in the test
    }
}
```

In the example above, the field `mockedDependency` is annotated with `@Mock`. Mockito will create a mock object of the `MyDependency` type, which can then be used within the test method.

2. **@InjectMocks**: The `@InjectMocks` annotation is used to automatically inject mock objects into the fields or constructor parameters of the test class under test.

Here's an example usage of `@InjectMocks`:

```java
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyTestClass {

    @Mock
    private MyDependency mockedDependency;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyClassUnderTest classUnderTest;

    @BeforeEach
    void setup() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
    }

    @Test
    void myTest() {
        // Use the classUnderTest, which will have the mockedDependency injected
    }
}
```

In the example above, the field `mockedDependency` is a mock object, and the field `classUnderTest` is the instance of the class being tested. By annotating `classUnderTest` with `@InjectMocks`, Mockito will automatically inject the `mockedDependency` into `classUnderTest`.

Note that in the example, the `setup()` method annotated with `@BeforeEach` is responsible for initializing the mocks using `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`.

Both `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` are part of the Mockito framework and can be used to simplify the creation and injection of mock objects during unit testing. They help reduce the boilerplate code required to manually create and wire mock objects in test classes.


### Q10. What is the stubbing?

Stubbing is a technique used in software testing to define the behavior of a mock object or stub. In the context of unit testing, stubbing involves setting up predefined responses or behaviors for specific method calls on mock objects.

### Q11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are a set of utility methods provided by the Mockito framework to match arguments passed to mocked methods during stubbing or verification. They allow developers to define flexible argument matching conditions when setting up stubbed behaviors or verifying method invocations.

ArgumentMatchers are typically used in conjunction with stubbing methods like `thenReturn()`, `thenThrow()`, or verification methods like `verify()`. They enable developers to define specific criteria for matching method arguments, including exact values, ranges, types, or custom matchers.

### Q12. what is Hamcrest Matchers?
Hamcrest Matchers is a library for writing expressive and readable assertions in Java. It provides a set of matchers that can be used with testing frameworks like JUnit or Mockito to perform assertions on objects and values. Hamcrest matchers allow developers to create more descriptive and intention-revealing assertions compared to traditional assertion methods provided by testing frameworks.

Hamcrest matchers follow a fluent and readable style, allowing assertions to be expressed in a natural language-like syntax. They can be used to verify various conditions, such as equality, nullness, type checking, collection contents, string matching, and more.

The key benefits of using Hamcrest matchers include:

1. **Readability**: Hamcrest matchers provide a more readable and expressive way of writing assertions. The fluent and descriptive syntax makes the intent of the assertion clear and enhances the readability of the test code.

2. **Composability**: Hamcrest matchers are composable, allowing developers to combine them to create complex assertions. This allows for building sophisticated assertions with minimal effort.

3. **Extensibility**: Hamcrest matchers are designed to be easily extensible. Developers can create their own custom matchers to match specific criteria or to enhance the library's existing matchers.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of Hamcrest matchers:

```java
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

@Test
void myTest() {
    String actual = "Hello, Hamcrest!";

    // Using Hamcrest matchers for assertions
    assertThat(actual, is(notNullValue()));
    assertThat(actual, containsString("Hello"));
    assertThat(actual, endsWith("!"));
    assertThat(actual, anyOf(startsWith("Hi"), endsWith("!")));
    assertThat(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3), hasSize(3));
    assertThat(10, greaterThan(5));
}
```

In the example above, Hamcrest matchers like `is`, `containsString`, `endsWith`, `anyOf`, `hasSize`, and `greaterThan` are used to perform various assertions on the `actual` value.

Hamcrest Matchers provides a rich set of matchers that cover a wide range of assertion scenarios. It is a standalone library that can be used independently or in conjunction with popular testing frameworks like JUnit or Mockito.

By using Hamcrest matchers, developers can write more expressive and readable assertions, leading to improved test code readability and maintainability.

### Q13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
Yes, I'm familiar with the `@Spy` annotation in Mockito. The `@Spy` annotation is used to create a partial mock object, which is a combination of a real object (the object under test) and a spy wrapper around it. On the other hand, the `@Mock` annotation is used to create a full mock object.

Here are the key differences between `@Spy` and `@Mock`:

1. **Object behavior**: When using `@Mock`, the entire object is mocked, and its behavior needs to be explicitly defined using stubbing. The original behavior of the mocked object's methods is not executed unless explicitly stubbed.

   With `@Spy`, on the other hand, a real object is instantiated and wrapped in a spy. The spy maintains the original behavior of the real object, but allows selective stubbing or verification of specific methods.

2. **Method invocation**: With `@Mock`, when a method is called on the mock object, the stubbed behavior or default values are returned. If a method is not stubbed, it typically returns default values based on the return type (e.g., null for objects, 0 for primitives).

   With `@Spy`, when a method is called on the spy, the actual implementation of the real object is invoked, unless the method has been stubbed. The spy allows you to selectively override or modify the behavior of specific methods while keeping the original behavior of others.

3. **Object state**: With `@Mock`, the mock object doesn't maintain the state of the original object, as it is entirely replaced by the mock. The state is typically not relevant in mock objects, as their purpose is to verify interactions or simulate specific behavior.

   With `@Spy`, the spy object maintains the state of the original object, as it is a wrapper around it. This can be useful when you need to verify how the object's state changes during method invocations.

4. **Constructor behavior**: When using `@Mock`, the mock object is created using the default constructor of the class being mocked.

   With `@Spy`, the real object is created using its regular constructor, and the spy wraps around it. This allows you to work with objects that may have complex or customized constructors.

In summary, `@Mock` is used for full mocking, where the entire object is replaced and its behavior needs to be defined explicitly. `@Spy` is used for partial mocking, where a real object is wrapped, allowing selective stubbing or verification while maintaining the original behavior and state of the object.

Both `@Mock` and `@Spy` are powerful tools in Mockito and serve different purposes depending on the testing scenario and the desired behavior of the object under test.
