see `annotaitons.md`

### Q2. what is the @configuration and @bean?

In the context of Java Spring Framework, `@Configuration` and `@Bean` are annotations used to define and configure beans.

`@Configuration` is used to mark a Java class as a configuration class, which means that the class is used to define beans that will be managed by the Spring container. The configuration class typically contains methods annotated with `@Bean`.

`@Bean` is used to mark a method inside a configuration class that returns an object to be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. The method name is used as the bean name by default, but you can specify a different name by providing a value to the `@Bean` annotation.

Here's an example:

```
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
    
}
```

In the above example, `MyConfig` is a configuration class that defines a bean named `myBean()`. The `myBean()` method returns an instance of `MyBean`, which is then managed by the Spring container. Other parts of the application can now use `@Autowired` to inject an instance of `MyBean` where needed.

### Q3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

In Spring, there are several ways to handle exceptions. Here are some of the most common approaches:

1. Using `@ExceptionHandler` annotation: This annotation can be used to define a method in a controller class that will handle a specific exception. The method can take the exception as a parameter and return a response or view to be displayed to the user. For example:

```
@ControllerAdvice
public class MyExceptionHandler {
 
    @ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)
    public ModelAndView handleMyException(MyException ex) {
        ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView("error");
        model.addObject("errorMessage", ex.getMessage());
        return model;
    }
 
}
```

In the above example, `@ControllerAdvice` is used to indicate that the class is a global exception handler. The `@ExceptionHandler` annotation is used to specify that the `handleMyException()` method should handle `MyException` and return a view named `error` with an error message.

2. Using Spring Boot's `ErrorController`: This is a default error controller that can be used to handle any unhandled exceptions. By default, it returns a JSON response with error details, but it can be customized to return a view or redirect to a specific URL. For example:

```
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/error")
public class MyErrorController implements ErrorController {
 
    @GetMapping
    public ModelAndView handleError(HttpServletRequest request) {
        ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView("error");
        model.addObject("statusCode", request.getAttribute(RequestDispatcher.ERROR_STATUS_CODE));
        model.addObject("errorMessage", request.getAttribute(RequestDispatcher.ERROR_MESSAGE));
        return model;
    }
 
    @Override
    public String getErrorPath() {
        return "/error";
    }
}
```

In the above example, `MyErrorController` implements the `ErrorController` interface and defines a `handleError()` method to handle all types of errors. The method returns a view named `error` with status code and error message attributes.

3. Using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ResponseStatus`: This approach can be used to handle exceptions by returning a specific HTTP status code and message. For example:

```
@ControllerAdvice
public class MyExceptionHandler {
 
    @ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
    public void handleMyException(MyException ex) {
        // do nothing, just return the HTTP status code and message
    }
 
}
```

In the above example, the `handleMyException()` method is annotated with `@ResponseStatus` to indicate that it should return a `400 Bad Request` status code. The method doesn't return anything, it just throws the exception.

These are just a few examples of how to handle exceptions in Spring. The approach you choose will depend on the specific requirements of your application.

### Q4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know.


In Spring, you can perform validations using the Bean Validation API, which is a specification for validating Java objects.

Here are the steps to perform validations in Spring:

1.  Add the Bean Validation API dependency to your project.

2.  Annotate your model class with validation annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`, etc. These annotations define the constraints on the properties of the model class.

3.  Use the `@Valid` annotation to validate the model object in the controller method.

4.  Handle the validation errors using `BindingResult` object in the controller method.


Here are some common validation annotations in Spring:

-   `@NotNull`: Validates that the annotated property is not null.
-   `@Size`: Validates that the size of the annotated property is within the specified range.
-   `@Min` and `@Max`: Validates that the annotated property is within the specified numeric range.
-   `@DecimalMin` and `@DecimalMax`: Validates that the annotated property is within the specified decimal range.
-   `@Pattern`: Validates that the annotated property matches the specified regular expression.
-   `@Email`: Validates that the annotated property is a valid email address.
-   `@AssertTrue` and `@AssertFalse`: Validates that the annotated property is true or false, respectively.

### Q5. What is the actuator?

In Spring, the Actuator is a set of tools and services that provide information about the running application, such as health, metrics, and other operational data. It enables you to monitor and manage your application at runtime, without requiring any additional configuration or dependencies.

The Actuator exposes various endpoints over HTTP or JMX that can be used to retrieve information about the application, such as:

- Health: Provides information about the health of the application, including its status, components, and dependencies.
- Metrics: Provides information about various metrics related to the application, such as CPU usage, memory usage, request/response rates, and so on.
- Info: Provides general information about the application, such as its name, version, and description.
- Trace: Provides information about the requests and responses processed by the application, including their status, headers, and body.
- Environment: Provides information about the environment in which the application is running, including system properties, configuration properties, and other settings.

The Actuator is highly extensible and configurable, and it provides several ways to customize and secure the endpoints based on your specific requirements.

To enable the Actuator in your Spring Boot application, you need to add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to your project, and it will automatically configure the Actuator endpoints based on the default settings. You can then customize the Actuator by adding configuration properties or by implementing your own custom endpoints.

### Q2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?

Spring is a popular open-source application framework for building enterprise-grade Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring focuses on making it easy to build complex, scalable, and high-performance applications using standard Java development techniques.

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that provides a pre-configured environment for developing production-grade Spring-based applications quickly and with minimal setup. Spring Boot provides a set of libraries and tools that make it easier to configure and deploy Spring applications. It eliminates the need for developers to write boilerplate code and manually configure the application environment. Instead, it provides a "convention-over-configuration" approach that automatically configures many aspects of the application based on sensible defaults.

Some of the benefits of using Spring Boot include:

1. Easy to get started: Spring Boot makes it easy to create and run a new Spring application with minimal setup and configuration.

2. Reduced boilerplate code: Spring Boot's opinionated approach reduces the amount of boilerplate code developers need to write, allowing them to focus on business logic.

3. Configuration made easy: Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature allows developers to avoid manual configuration of the application, reducing the potential for errors and improving development speed.

4. Faster development: Spring Boot's ability to quickly spin up a development environment and provide a live reload feature that automatically rebuilds and restarts the application, making it easier to develop and test changes.

5. Large community support: Spring Boot has a large and active community that provides a wealth of resources and support, making it easier to learn and troubleshoot issues.

### Q3. What is IOC and What is DI?

IOC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection) are two key concepts in the Spring framework that help make it easy to build and manage complex applications.

IOC is a design pattern that enables the framework to take control of object creation and management, instead of leaving it to the developer. In traditional programming, the application code creates objects and manages their lifecycle. With IOC, the framework takes on this responsibility, freeing up the application code to focus on business logic. IOC achieves this by inverting the flow of control in the application. Instead of the application code controlling the creation and management of objects, the framework controls it.

DI is a pattern used in conjunction with IOC. It involves passing the dependencies (i.e., the objects that a class needs to function) of a class as parameters, rather than creating them inside the class itself. This allows for more flexibility and easier testing, as dependencies can be easily swapped out without affecting the functionality of the class.

In practical terms, DI involves creating a container that holds all the objects that an application needs to run. The container then injects these objects into the classes that need them. This approach allows for a more modular and maintainable application architecture, as well as easier unit testing.

In Spring, IOC and DI are implemented through the use of the ApplicationContext container, which manages the creation and configuration of objects and their dependencies. Developers simply define the beans (i.e., the objects) they need in an XML or Java configuration file, and the container takes care of the rest. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined development process, as developers can focus on the application's core functionality instead of managing object creation and configuration.

### Q4. What is @CompnonentScan?

`  
@ComponentScan` is a Spring annotation that instructs Spring to scan a specific package and its sub-packages for Spring-managed components, such as `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations, and register them as beans in the Spring application context.

When a Spring application starts up, it creates an ApplicationContext container that manages the lifecycle of all Spring-managed components. By default, Spring scans the package where the main application class is located for components that need to be managed. However, in many cases, components may be located in other packages. `@ComponentScan` allows you to specify which packages to scan for components.

### Q5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

In Spring, you can configure which packages to scan for components in both XML and Java configuration files.

In XML configuration, you can use the `<context:component-scan>` element to specify the packages to scan. The element can be added to your Spring configuration file, like this:

```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.app" />
```

In this example, the `base-package` attribute specifies the package to scan for components.

In Java configuration, you can use the `@ComponentScan` annotation to specify the packages to scan. You can add this annotation to a class annotated with `@Configuration` or `@SpringBootApplication`, like this:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example.app"})
public class AppConfig {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `basePackages` attribute of `@ComponentScan` specifies the package to scan for components.

Both XML and Java configuration offer additional configuration options for scanning components, such as excluding specific packages or classes, specifying annotations to include or exclude, and setting filter conditions based on component metadata. These options can be useful for fine-tuning the component scanning process and optimizing the performance of your application.

### Q6. What is @SpringbootApplication?

`@SpringBootApplication` is a meta-annotation in Spring Boot that combines three other annotations: `@Configuration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. This annotation is commonly used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.

The `@Configuration` annotation indicates that the class contains Spring configuration, while `@ComponentScan` tells Spring where to find the components of the application. `@EnableAutoConfiguration` enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism, which automatically configures the application based on its dependencies.

Using `@SpringBootApplication` instead of the three separate annotations provides a simpler and more concise way to configure a Spring Boot application. The annotation also provides additional functionality, such as enabling logging and creating the SpringApplication instance for the application.

Here is an example of a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyApp` is the main class of the Spring Boot application. The `main` method calls `SpringApplication.run` to start the application, which loads the Spring context, scans for components, and starts the embedded web server, if applicable.

`@SpringBootApplication` is a powerful annotation that simplifies the configuration of Spring Boot applications, and is often used as a starting point for developing a new Spring Boot project.

### Q7. How many ways we can define a bean?

In Spring, there are several ways to define a bean. Some of the most common ways include:

1. Using `@Bean` annotation: You can define a bean using the `@Bean` annotation on a method in a configuration class. The method creates an instance of the bean and returns it.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

2. Using XML configuration: You can define a bean in an XML file using the `<bean>` element. The element specifies the class of the bean and any dependencies it requires.

```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="dependency" ref="myDependency" />
</bean>

<bean id="myDependency" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
```

3. Using Java configuration: You can define a bean in a Java configuration class using the `@Component` annotation or one of its stereotypes, such as `@Service` or `@Repository`.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    // ...
}
```

4. Using component scanning: Spring can automatically detect and create beans for classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller` annotations.

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    // ...
}
```

5. Using factory methods: You can define a bean using a factory method in a configuration class. The method creates an instance of the bean and returns it.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean(MyDependency myDependency) {
        return new MyBean(myDependency);
    }

    @Bean
    public MyDependency myDependency() {
        return new MyDependency();
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many ways you can define a bean in Spring. The choice of method depends on the needs of your application and personal preference.

### Q8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

In Spring, the default bean name for a component annotated with `@Component` is the uncapitalized non-qualified class name. For example, if you have a component class named `MyComponent`, the default bean name will be `myComponent`.

### Q9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?

In Spring, `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are three stereotypes that are used to annotate classes and indicate their roles in the application. Although all three of them are used to indicate that a class is a Spring-managed component, they have some differences in their intended use and functionality.

`@Component` is a generic stereotype and can be used for any class. It is primarily used to indicate that a class is a Spring-managed component.

`@Service` is a specialization of `@Component`. It is used to indicate that a class represents a service layer in the application. Service classes typically contain business logic and may communicate with the data access layer.

`@Repository` is also a specialization of `@Component`. It is used to indicate that a class represents a data access layer in the application. Repository classes typically handle data access and manipulation, such as querying a database or reading and writing to files.

Here's an example that illustrates the use of all three annotations:

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    // ...
}

@Service
public class MyService {
    // ...
}

@Repository
public class MyRepository {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `MyComponent` is a generic Spring-managed component, `MyService` represents a service layer component, and `MyRepository` represents a data access layer component.

While the three annotations have different intended uses, they are functionally equivalent in terms of how Spring treats them. All three annotations indicate that a class is a Spring-managed component, and all three will be picked up by component scanning and added to the Spring application context.

### Q10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

There are several annotations in Spring that can be used to inject a bean:

1. `@Autowired`: This annotation can be used to inject a bean automatically by type. Spring will search for a bean of the same type and inject it into the annotated field, constructor parameter, or setter method.

2. `@Qualifier`: This annotation can be used in conjunction with `@Autowired` to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type.

3. `@Resource`: This annotation can also be used to inject a bean by name or by type. It is a Java EE standard annotation that can be used in Spring applications as well.

4. `@Inject`: This is another annotation that can be used to inject a bean by type. It is a standard Java annotation that is supported by Spring.

5. `@Value`: This annotation can be used to inject a value into a field or method parameter. The value can be a simple string, a property placeholder, or an expression.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier` to inject a bean:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("myRepository")
    private MyRepository repository;
    
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `MyService` is a Spring-managed service class that has a field named `repository`. The `@Autowired` annotation is used to indicate that Spring should inject a bean of the same type as `MyRepository` into this field. Since there may be multiple beans of this type, the `@Qualifier` annotation is used to specify the name of the bean to inject.

### Q11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

In Spring, there are three ways to perform dependency injection:

1. Constructor Injection: In this approach, dependencies are injected via a class constructor. The dependencies are passed to the constructor as parameters, and Spring uses the constructor to create an instance of the class and inject the dependencies.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    
    private final MyRepository repository;
    
    public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `MyService` has a single constructor that takes a `MyRepository` parameter. When Spring creates an instance of `MyService`, it will use this constructor to inject the `MyRepository` bean.

2. Setter Injection: In this approach, dependencies are injected via setter methods. The class has a setter method for each dependency, and Spring uses these methods to inject the dependencies.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    
    private MyRepository repository;
    
    @Autowired
    public void setRepository(MyRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `MyService` has a setter method named `setRepository` that takes a `MyRepository` parameter. When Spring creates an instance of `MyService`, it will call this method to inject the `MyRepository` bean.

3. Field Injection: In this approach, dependencies are injected directly into class fields. The class has a field for each dependency, and Spring uses reflection to set the value of these fields.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    
    @Autowired
    private MyRepository repository;
    
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `MyService` has a field named `repository`. When Spring creates an instance of `MyService`, it will use reflection to inject the `MyRepository` bean into this field.

All three approaches have their pros and cons, and the best approach depends on the specific use case. Constructor injection is generally considered to be the best approach, as it makes dependencies explicit and ensures that they are available when the class is created. It also makes the class easier to test, as dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed in unit tests.

Setter injection and field injection are sometimes used for convenience or to reduce boilerplate code, but they can make it harder to reason about the class and its dependencies. They can also make the class harder to test, as dependencies may not be available until after the class has been created. However, these approaches can be useful in certain cases, such as when dealing with legacy code or third-party libraries that do not provide constructors for dependency injection.

### Q12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

If you have multiple beans of the same type in your Spring context, you can use the `@Primary` annotation to specify which one should be used as the default. When a bean has the `@Primary` annotation, it is preferred over other beans of the same type when more than one bean is a candidate for autowiring.

Here's an example of using `@Primary`:

```java
@Service
@Primary
public class MyPrimaryService implements MyService {
    // ...
}

@Service
public class MyFallbackService implements MyService {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, we have two implementations of the `MyService` interface: `MyPrimaryService` and `MyFallbackService`. The `@Primary` annotation is used to specify that `MyPrimaryService` is the default implementation that should be used when autowiring `MyService`.

If there is no primary bean defined, or if you want to use a different bean than the primary one, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify the name of the bean to be injected. Here's an example:

```java
@Service
public class MyServiceConsumer {
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("myFallbackService")
    private MyService service;
    
    // ...
}
```

In this example, we have a class named `MyServiceConsumer` that has a field of type `MyService`. We use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify that we want to inject the `MyFallbackService` bean into this field, rather than the primary bean.

### Q13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

`BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext` are both interfaces in Spring that define the basic functionality of the Spring IoC container. However, they have some key differences:

1. BeanFactory is the basic container interface while ApplicationContext is a subinterface of BeanFactory. ApplicationContext provides additional functionality such as message handling, event propagation, internationalization, and more.

2. BeanFactory is a more lightweight container as it only provides the basic features of the container. ApplicationContext provides additional features such as integration with Spring AOP, automatic `BeanPostProcessor` registration, and support for multiple configuration files.

3. BeanFactory uses lazy loading of beans, which means that the beans are created only when they are requested. This can lead to slower application startup times but can be more memory-efficient for large applications. ApplicationContext, on the other hand, uses eager loading of beans, which means that the beans are created at startup. This can lead to faster application startup times but can be less memory-efficient for large applications.

4. BeanFactory is suitable for use in standalone applications or in low-memory environments. ApplicationContext is suitable for use in web applications or in high-memory environments where additional features are required.

In general, if you require the additional features provided by ApplicationContext, such as AOP or automatic `BeanPostProcessor` registration, you should use it. Otherwise, if you have a standalone application or are working in a low-memory environment, you can use BeanFactory.

### Q14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

In Spring, the scope of a bean defines how long that bean will live and how many instances of that bean will be created. Spring supports several scopes for beans, each of which is designed to meet different requirements. The most common scopes are:

1. Singleton: The singleton scope creates only one instance of a bean per container. All requests for the bean will return the same instance. This is the default scope of a bean in Spring.

2. Prototype: The prototype scope creates a new instance of a bean every time a request for the bean is made. This means that multiple instances of the bean can exist in the container at the same time.

3. Request: The request scope creates a new instance of a bean for each HTTP request that is handled by the Spring MVC dispatcher servlet.

4. Session: The session scope creates a new instance of a bean for each HTTP session. This means that the same instance of the bean is used throughout the entire session.

5. Global session: The global session scope creates a new instance of a bean for each global HTTP session. This scope is only available in a portlet context.

6. Application: The application scope creates a single instance of a bean for each web application context. This means that the same instance of the bean is used throughout the entire application.

7. Websocket: The websocket scope creates a new instance of a bean for each websocket session.

Here are some examples of each scope:

1. Singleton: DAOs, services, controllers, and other stateless beans that should have a single instance.

2. Prototype: Command objects, form-backing objects, or any object that needs to be stateful.

3. Request: Objects that should exist only for the duration of an HTTP request, such as web controllers or view objects.

4. Session: Objects that should exist only for the duration of an HTTP session, such as shopping cart objects.

5. Global session: Objects that should exist only for the duration of a global HTTP session, such as user authentication objects.

6. Application: Objects that should exist for the entire lifetime of a web application, such as application-level caches or managers.

7. Websocket: Objects that should exist only for the duration of a websocket session, such as chat rooms or other real-time communication objects.

### Q15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml,  and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)

To configure a bean using XML in Spring, you need to define the bean in an XML file and specify its properties, constructor arguments, and dependencies. Here's an example of how to configure a bean with dependencies using XML:

Suppose we have a class `MyService` that requires an instance of `MyDao` to be injected:

```java
public class MyService {
    private MyDao myDao;
    
    public MyService(MyDao myDao) {
        this.myDao = myDao;
    }
    
    // ...
}

public class MyDao {
    // ...
}
```

To configure `MyService` using XML, we need to define the `MyService` bean in an XML file and inject the `MyDao` dependency:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.3.xsd">

    <bean id="myDao" class="com.example.MyDao" />
    
    <bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
        <constructor-arg ref="myDao" />
    </bean>

</beans>
```

In the XML configuration above, we first define the `MyDao` bean with the `id` of `myDao` and the fully qualified class name of `com.example.MyDao`. Then we define the `MyService` bean with the `id` of `myService` and the fully qualified class name of `com.example.MyService`. We also use the `constructor-arg` element to inject the `myDao` bean as a constructor argument for `MyService`.

You can also set properties of a bean using the `property` element instead of the `constructor-arg` element:

```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
    <property name="myDao" ref="myDao" />
</bean>
```

In this case, we use the `property` element to set the `myDao` property of `MyService` to the `myDao` bean using its `id`.

Note that in order to use XML configuration in Spring, you need to define a `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext` that loads the XML configuration file and creates the beans defined in it.
