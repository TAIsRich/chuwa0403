In Java, a volatile variable is used to indicate that the value of the variable may change unexpectedly. It ensures that the value of the variable is always read from and written to the main memory, and not from the local cache of the thread.

This keyword is typically used when multiple threads access a shared variable, to ensure that all threads see the most recent value of the variable. It can be used in the Singleton pattern to create a thread-safe instance.

- Extending the Thread class
- Implementing Runnable interface
- Using Lambda expressions
- Using ExecutorService (Thread Pool)

## 3.
Runnable is an interface with a single method run() that does not return a value, while Callable is an interface with a single method call() that returns a value and can throw an exception.

The key difference between the two interfaces is that Runnable is used for tasks that do not return a value, while Callable is used for tasks that return a value and can throw an exception.

## 4.
In Java, `t.start()` and `t.run()` are two methods used to start a new thread of execution for a given `Thread` object `t`.

The main difference between `t.start()` and `t.run()` is that `t.start()` creates a new thread of execution and then invokes the `run()` method of the thread in a separate call stack, while `t.run()` simply invokes the `run()` method of the current thread.

Therefore, if you call `t.start()`, the `run()` method of the `t` object will execute in a new thread, whereas if you call `t.run()`, the `run()` method will execute in the same thread that made the `t.run()` call.

In summary, if you want to start a new thread of execution, you should use `t.start()`. If you want to execute the `run()` method of a `Thread` object in the current thread, you can use `t.run()`.

## 5.
In general, implementing the Runnable interface is considered to be a better approach for creating threads, because it allows for better separation of concerns and promotes code reuse. When you implement the Runnable interface, you define a run() method that represents the actual work to be done by the thread. This run() method can be shared by multiple threads, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

## 6.
In Java, a thread can be in one of several states at any given time, which is known as its "thread status". The possible thread states are:

1. `NEW`: A thread is in this state when it has been created but has not yet started.
2. `RUNNABLE`: A thread is in this state when it is executing, or is ready to execute, but is not currently blocked.
3. `BLOCKED`: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a monitor lock to be released, so that it can enter a synchronized block or method.
4. `WAITING`: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for some other thread to perform a particular action, such as notifying it or interrupting it.
5. `TIMED_WAITING`: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for some other thread to perform a particular action, but with a timeout period specified.
6. `TERMINATED`: A thread is in this state when it has completed execution or has been terminated prematurely.

## 7.
- `wait()` is used to suspend a thread and release the lock associated with the object on which it is called, while `sleep()` is used to pause the execution of a thread for a specified period of time.
- `wait()` is typically used in synchronization blocks or methods, while `sleep()` can be used anywhere.
- `wait()` can be called with a timeout period, while `sleep()` always waits for the full specified time.
- `wait()` can be resumed by another thread calling `notify()` or `notifyAll()`, while `sleep()` can only be resumed by the passage of time.

## 8.
A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads or processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources, preventing any of them from continuing their execution. Deadlocks can occur in multi-threaded programs when two or more threads acquire locks on shared resources in a different order. To prevent deadlocks, it's essential to ensure that threads acquire locks on shared resources in the same order and release them promptly after use. Java provides several tools for detecting and resolving deadlocks, such as thread dumps and profiling tools, which can help identify the source of the problem and suggest ways to avoid it. It's important to design multithreaded programs carefully to avoid deadlocks.

## 9.
In Java, threads can communicate with each other through the shared memory space. This means that threads can read and write data to shared variables, arrays, and objects, allowing them to exchange information and synchronize their actions.

## 10.
In Java, the join() method is a thread synchronization mechanism that allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread before continuing its own execution. When a thread calls the join() method on another thread, it blocks until the other thread completes its execution.

## 11.
In Java, the yield() method is a thread control mechanism that is used to give a hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU. When a thread calls the yield() method, it temporarily gives up the CPU, allowing other threads to run.

## 12.
A thread pool is a collection of worker threads that are available for performing concurrent tasks in a Java program. Instead of creating a new thread for each task, a thread pool provides a group of pre-initialized threads that are ready to execute tasks as they become available. This approach can improve performance and reduce overhead by minimizing the number of threads that need to be created and destroyed.

## 13.
The Executor Framework is a high-level abstraction in Java that provides a standard way of executing tasks in a multithreaded environment. It provides several benefits, such as improved performance, simplified task management, and better resource utilization. The framework consists of three main components: the Executor, ExecutorService, and ScheduledExecutorService interfaces.

## 14.
The shutdown() method initiates an orderly shutdown of the ExecutorService. When shutdown() is called, the ExecutorService will stop accepting new tasks, and it will continue to execute any previously submitted tasks until they are completed. Once all tasks are completed, the ExecutorService will shut down, and its threads will be terminated. If any tasks are still running when shutdown() is called, they will be allowed to complete before the ExecutorService is shut down.

## 15.
In Java, the Atomic classes are a set of thread-safe classes that provide atomic operations on single variables. These classes use atomic operations that guarantee that the operation is executed as a single, indivisible action without interference from other threads.

## 16.
The Concurrent Collections framework includes several classes, such as ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, ConcurrentSkipListMap, and CopyOnWriteArrayList, among others. These classes provide a variety of data structures, such as maps, sets, queues, and lists, that are designed to work efficiently and safely in a concurrent environment.

| Lock Type | Associated with | Scope | Visibility |
|-----------|----------------|-------|------------|
| Class Lock | Class | Across all instances of a class | Visible to all threads that access static methods or variables of the class |
| Object Lock | Object/Instance of a Class | Specific to individual objects/instances | Visible only to threads that access instance methods or variables of the object/instance |

## 19.
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Future | A Future is a type of object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods for checking if the computation is complete, retrieving the result of the computation, and canceling the computation if it has not already completed. |
| CompletableFuture | A CompletableFuture is a subclass of Future that provides additional functionality for composing asynchronous computations. It allows for the chaining of multiple computations, specifying custom thread pools, handling exceptions, and combining the results of multiple computations. It also supports a wide range of callback methods that can be executed when the computation is complete or when certain events occur. |

## 20.
In Java, ThreadLocal is a class that provides thread-local variables. A thread-local variable is a variable that is local to a particular thread, meaning that each thread has its own copy of the variable. This can be useful in situations where multiple threads access and modify the same variable, but you want to ensure that each thread has its own independent copy of the variable.
