see `annotations.md`

### Q2. What is MVC pattern?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. The MVC pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and provides methods to access and manipulate it.

The View is responsible for rendering the user interface. It displays the data from the Model and provides a way for the user to interact with the application.

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, updates the Model accordingly, and then updates the View with the new data.

By separating the concerns of the application into distinct components, the MVC pattern makes it easier to maintain and modify the code. For example, changes to the user interface can be made without affecting the underlying data or business logic, and changes to the data model can be made without affecting the way the data is displayed to the user.

### Q3. What is Front-Controller?

Front Controller is a software design pattern commonly used in web application development. It is used to centralize and handle all incoming requests to a web application.

The Front Controller pattern works by providing a single entry point for all requests to the application. When a request is made, the Front Controller handles it and delegates to the appropriate handlers or controllers to handle the request.

The Front Controller is responsible for processing requests, routing them to the appropriate controllers or handlers, and handling common tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. By centralizing these tasks, the Front Controller can simplify the code and make it easier to maintain and modify.

One of the advantages of using a Front Controller is that it allows for a consistent approach to handling requests across the application. It also enables the use of common features such as security checks and logging across all parts of the application. Additionally, it makes it easier to implement features such as URL routing and handling different types of requests, such as AJAX requests or file uploads.

Overall, the Front Controller pattern is a useful way to organize and manage the request-handling logic in web applications.

### Q4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

DispatcherServlet is a central component of the Spring Framework's web application support that implements the Front Controller pattern. It acts as a front controller for Spring-based web applications, handling all incoming requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers.

When a request is made to a Spring-based web application, it is first received by the web server. The web server then passes the request to the DispatcherServlet, which acts as a front controller. The DispatcherServlet examines the request to determine the appropriate handler to dispatch it to.

The DispatcherServlet uses a set of HandlerMappings to determine which handler should process the request. A HandlerMapping is responsible for mapping a request to a specific handler or controller based on the request URL or other criteria. Once the appropriate HandlerMapping has been identified, the DispatcherServlet delegates the request to the corresponding handler or controller.

The handler or controller processes the request and returns a ModelAndView object to the DispatcherServlet. The ModelAndView object contains information about the view to be rendered and any model data to be displayed in the view.

The DispatcherServlet then uses a set of ViewResolvers to determine the appropriate view to render. A ViewResolver is responsible for mapping a view name to a specific view implementation, such as a JSP or Thymeleaf template. Once the appropriate view has been identified, the DispatcherServlet delegates the rendering of the view to the corresponding View implementation.

Finally, the rendered view is returned to the user as an HTTP response. If necessary, the DispatcherServlet can also perform additional processing, such as post-processing of the response or error handling.

Overall, the DispatcherServlet is a key component of Spring-based web applications, providing a centralized request-handling mechanism that simplifies application development and improves maintainability.

### Q5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ(please google to have a basic knowlege)

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java-based web applications. JSP pages are compiled into Java Servlets, which are executed by a web container such as Apache Tomcat. JSP allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages, making it easier to create dynamic web content that is customized to each user.

ModelAndView is a class in the Spring Framework that is used to represent the model and view components of a web application. The model component contains the data that is passed to the view for rendering, while the view component defines the presentation of the data.

When a request is made to a Spring-based web application, a controller processes the request and creates a ModelAndView object. The ModelAndView object contains the name of the view to be rendered and any model data to be displayed in the view. The controller then returns the ModelAndView object to the DispatcherServlet, which uses it to render the view and return it to the user as an HTTP response.

The use of ModelAndView in Spring-based web applications allows developers to separate the model and view components of their applications, making it easier to manage and maintain the code. By using a standardized object to represent the model and view components, developers can also make their code more modular and easier to test.

### Q6. Could you please google any other servlets

Sure, here are a few other servlets:

1. HttpServlet: This is an abstract class that extends the GenericServlet class and provides additional functionality for handling HTTP requests and responses. HttpServlet is commonly used in web applications that use the HTTP protocol.

2. JspServlet: This is a servlet that is used to handle JSP pages. It compiles JSP pages into Java Servlets and handles requests to these Servlets.

3. RequestDispatcher: This is not a servlet itself, but rather an interface that is used to forward requests from one servlet to another servlet or JSP page. RequestDispatcher is commonly used in web applications to handle complex request processing logic.

4. AsyncContext: This is an interface that is used to support asynchronous request processing in Servlets. It allows Servlets to handle long-running requests without tying up server resources, which can improve the performance and scalability of web applications.

5. Filter: This is an interface that is used to intercept requests and responses before they are processed by a Servlet or JSP page. Filters are commonly used in web applications to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and content compression.

These are just a few examples of the many Servlets that are available for use in Java-based web applications. Each Servlet provides a specific set of functionality for handling requests and responses, and can be combined with other Servlets and JSP pages to create complex web applications.

### Q7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)

There are many web servers available for use in Java-based web applications. Here are a few popular examples:

1. Apache Tomcat: This is a widely used open-source web server and Servlet container that implements the Java Servlet and JSP specifications. It is known for its lightweight and fast performance, and is commonly used in small to medium-sized web applications.

2. Jetty: This is another open-source web server and Servlet container that is known for its high performance and low resource usage. Jetty is used in a wide range of applications, from small embedded devices to large web services.

3. JBoss/WildFly: This is an open-source Java EE application server that includes a web server and Servlet container. It provides a full range of Java EE features, including support for EJBs, JMS, and JPA.

4. Apache HTTP Server: This is a widely used open-source web server that is not specific to Java-based web applications, but can be used to serve static content or to proxy requests to a Java-based web server such as Tomcat or Jetty.

5. GlassFish: This is another open-source Java EE application server that includes a web server and Servlet container. It provides a wide range of Java EE features and is commonly used in enterprise applications.

These are just a few examples of the many web servers that are available for use in Java-based web applications. Each web server provides different features and performance characteristics, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
