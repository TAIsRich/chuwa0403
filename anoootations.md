@Controller: This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring MVC controller. It handles incoming HTTP requests and returns an appropriate view or data.

@RestController: This annotation is used to combine @Controller and @ResponseBody. It is used to create RESTful web services by returning data directly in the response body, rather than rendering a view.

@RequestMapping: This annotation is used to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods. It can be applied at the class level or method level, and allows you to specify the URL, HTTP method, and other request parameters.

@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: These annotations are shortcuts for @RequestMapping with specific HTTP methods. They are used to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively.

@PathVariable: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a URI template variable. It allows you to extract values from the URL and use them in your controller methods.

@RequestParam: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a query parameter or form data. It allows you to retrieve values from the request parameters.

@RequestBody: This annotation is used to bind the request body to a method parameter. It is commonly used to parse JSON or XML payloads in RESTful APIs.

@Autowired: This annotation is used to automatically wire dependencies between Spring beans. It injects an instance of a bean into another bean.

@Component: This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring component. It is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component and is typically used with the @Autowired annotation.

@Service: This annotation is used to mark a class as a service bean. It is typically used in the service layer of an application to perform business logic.

@Repository: This annotation is used to mark a class as a repository bean. It is used in the persistence layer to interact with databases or other data sources.

@Configuration: This annotation is used to indicate that a class declares Spring bean configurations. It is often used in combination with @Bean to define and register beans in the Spring application context.

@Bean: This annotation is used to declare a bean definition for a method within a @Configuration class. It tells Spring to manage the lifecycle of the bean and make it available for dependency injection.

@Qualifier: This annotation is used to resolve ambiguities when multiple beans of the same type are present. It works in conjunction with @Autowired to specify which bean should be injected.

@Value: This annotation is used to inject values from properties files or environment variables into Spring beans. It can be applied to fields, methods, or constructor parameters.

@Scope: This annotation is used to define the scope of a bean. It allows you to control how instances of the bean are created and managed, such as singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.

@Async: This annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed asynchronously. It allows you to offload time-consuming tasks to separate threads and improve application performance.

@Transactional: This annotation is used to demarcate transactional boundaries around methods or classes. It enables declarative transaction management, where Spring automatically handles transaction begin, commit, and rollback.

@ExceptionHandler: This annotation is used to define a method that handles exceptions thrown within a controller. It allows you to centralize the handling of specific exceptions and return appropriate error responses.

@Cacheable, @CacheEvict: These annotations are used for caching in Spring applications. @Cacheable is applied to a method to cache its result, and @CacheEvict is used to evict specific or all cache entries.

@Scheduled: This annotation is used to schedule the execution of a method at fixed intervals or cron expressions. It is commonly used for tasks such as batch processing or periodic jobs.

@Profile: This annotation is used to activate or deactivate beans based on the specified profiles. It allows you to have different configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, or production.

@EnableWebMvc: This annotation is used to enable the Spring MVC configuration in a web application. It is typically applied to a configuration class and imports the necessary Spring MVC configuration beans.

@EnableJpaRepositories: This annotation is used to enable JPA repository support in a Spring application. It is usually applied to a configuration class and specifies the base packages where the repositories are located.

@EnableTransactionManagement: This annotation is used to enable Spring's annotation-driven transaction management. It is typically applied to a configuration class and activates the necessary Spring infrastructure beans for managing transactions.

@EnableCaching: This annotation is used to enable Spring's caching support. It is applied to a configuration class and activates the necessary infrastructure beans for caching data in the application.

@Entity: This annotation is used to mark a class as a persistent entity in JPA (Java Persistence API). It is typically applied to a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class that represents a table in a database.

@Table: This annotation is used to specify the table name and other details for an entity class. It is typically applied to a class annotated with @Entity.

@Column: This annotation is used to specify the column name, data type, and other details for a field in an entity class. It is typically applied to a field in a class annotated with @Entity.

@JsonIgnore: This annotation is used to ignore a specific field or property during serialization and deserialization of JSON data. It is commonly used in RESTful APIs to exclude sensitive information from being exposed.

@ModelAttribute: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a model attribute. It is typically used in Spring MVC to retrieve data from the model and populate it into a method parameter.

@ExceptionHandler: This annotation is used to define a method that handles exceptions thrown within a controller advice class. It allows you to handle exceptions globally across multiple controllers.

@Valid: This annotation is used to enable validation on a method parameter or method return value. It triggers the validation process based on constraints defined on the corresponding bean.
