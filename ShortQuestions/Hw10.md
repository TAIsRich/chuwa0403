## 5. What is HTTP Session?
HTTP session is server side storage mechanism used to maintain state across multiple requests from the same user. When a user logs into a web application or performs an action that requires state management, a session is created on the server. A unique session ID is generated and send to the client as cookie or sometimes as a part of URL.

Sessions are produced and managed by server. The server associates incoming requests with the correct session using the session ID sent from the client.

## 6. What is Cookie? 
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server to a user's browser. The browser stores the cookie and sends it bacj every subsequent request to the same server. This allows the server to identify and track users and remember their preferences or otehr data.

Session stores and maintained in the server side, cookie stores and maintained  on the browser.

Sessions are more secure and flexible for storing sensitive information, while cookies are widely used for various purposes and can be managed by the client.

## 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
A session is created the first time, a user access a website or performs action that need to maintain a state.

Then the server creates a cookie and send it back to the client. A session Id is stored in the cookie.

The next time the user enter the same server carring the cookie, the server will look up the session using the session id.
