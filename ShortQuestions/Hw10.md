# Homework 10
## 1.
## 2. What is the authentication?
Authentication is "who you are", refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or client accessing a protected resource. 
It ensures that the user is who they claim to be before granting access to the requested resources or performing certain actions.
## 3. What is the authorization?
Authorization refers to the process of determining whether a user or client has the necessary permissions and privileges to access a specific resource or perform a certain action within an application or system. It ensures that authenticated users are granted appropriate access rights based on their roles, permissions, or other authorization rules.

## 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Authentication verifies the identification of the client while authorization is the process of determine the privileges of a user to be granted with certain resources. First authentication then authorization.

## 5. What is HTTP Session?
HTTP session is server side storage mechanism used to maintain state across multiple requests from the same user. When a user logs into a web application or performs an action that requires state management, a session is created on the server. A unique session ID is generated and send to the client as cookie or sometimes as a part of URL.

Sessions are produced and managed by server. The server associates incoming requests with the correct session using the session ID sent from the client.

## 6. What is Cookie? 
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server to a user's browser. The browser stores the cookie and sends it bacj every subsequent request to the same server. This allows the server to identify and track users and remember their preferences or otehr data. 

Cookies are produced on the server and send to the client through HTTP heades. When a browser receive the cookie, it stores it locally and includes in the future requests using the Cookie header.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Session stores and maintained in the server side, cookie stores and maintained  on the browser.

Sessions are more secure and flexible for storing sensitive information, while cookies are widely used for various purposes and can be managed by the client.

## 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
A session is created the first time, a user access a website or performs action that need to maintain a state.

Then the server creates a cookie and send it back to the client. A session Id is stored in the cookie.

The next time the user enter the same server carring the cookie, the server will look up the session using the session id.


## 9. What is JWT?
Json Web Token is a compact between client and server and is used for authenticatoin and authorization purposes in modern web application. It is stateless means the server doesn't need to store session information. 

It is composed of 3 parts:

Header: type and algo;

Payload: id, iat, etc.

Signature: generated using the header and payload with a secret string for authentication.

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
Spring security filter provides a set of pre-configured filters that are applied in a specific order to intercept and process incoming requests, perfrom authentication, authorization and other security related operations.

The Spring Security filter chain is responsible for processing requests and applying security measures based on the configured rules. Each filter in the chain performs a specific security task and can modify the request or response as necessary. 

AuthenticationFilter: This filter handles the authentication process, typically by inspecting the request for credentials (e.g., username/password or token) and verifying them against a user store or authentication provider.

AuthorizationFilter: This filter checks whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. It enforces access control rules based on roles, permissions, or other authorization mechanisms.

SessionManagementFilter: This filter manages user sessions, handling tasks such as session creation, tracking, and expiration. It can also handle session fixation protection, concurrent session control, and other session-related security measures.

CsrfFilter: This filter provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by adding and validating CSRF tokens in requests.

CorsFilter: This filter handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests, enforcing security policies for cross-origin communication between a client and server.

LogoutFilter: This filter handles the user logout process, clearing authentication-related information and performing any necessary cleanup tasks.

ExceptionTranslationFilter: This filter catches and handles any exceptions that occur during the authentication or authorization process. It maps exceptions to appropriate error responses or redirects as configured.

## 11. decribe how does JWT work
1. The user log in to a server using username and password.
2. The server generate a JWT token, put it in the http header and send it back to the user. These claims can include information such as the user's identity, roles, or any other relevant data. The client receives and stores the JWT for subsequent requests.
3. The next time the user make a request to the same server using the same JWT token;
4. The server verifies the token whether it matches the signature token or not.
5.  If the token and its claims are valid, the server processes the request and provides the requested resources or performs the requested action on behalf of the user.
6.  f the JWT has an expiration time, the client can request a new JWT by using a refresh token (if provided) or by re-authenticating with the server. This helps maintain session continuity without requiring the user to provide their credentials again.

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
BCryptPasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the BCrypt hashing algorithm, which is a popular and secure algorithm for password hashing. It automatically generates a random salt for each password, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder: This encoder implements the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) algorithm. PBKDF2 applies a cryptographic hash function repeatedly to increase the computational cost of password hashing, making it more difficult for attackers to perform brute-force attacks.

SCryptPasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the scrypt algorithm, which is a memory-hard function designed to make password cracking costly in terms of time and computational resources. It provides an additional layer of security compared to traditional hashing algorithms.

StandardPasswordEncoder: This encoder implements a simple password hashing scheme based on SHA-256. While not as strong as the other encoders mentioned above, it can be useful for legacy systems or as a transitional step when migrating to stronger hashing algorithms.

Base64 is an encoding scheme rather than a password encoder specifically. It is commonly used for encoding binary data into a textual format that is safe for transmission over certain channels, such as email or HTTP headers, where only ASCII characters are allowed.

## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
* UserDetailService: UserDetailsService is an interface provided by the Spring Security framework in Java. It is used to retrieve user details and authentication information from a backend data source, such as a database or an external service. The UserDetailsService interface defines a single method called loadUserByUsername(), which is responsible for retrieving user details based on a given username. The method takes the username as input and returns an implementation of the UserDetails interface.
* Authetication Provider: AuthenticationProvider is an interface provided by the Spring Security framework in Java. It is responsible for authenticating user credentials and creating an Authentication object, which represents the user's authentication status and associated authorities (roles). The AuthenticationProvider interface defines a single method called authenticate(), which takes an Authentication object as input and returns a fully authenticated Authentication object. The authenticate() method performs the actual authentication process, including verifying the user's credentials, checking the user's account status, and assigning the appropriate authorities.
* AuthenticationManager: AuthenticationManager is a core interface provided by the Spring Security framework in Java. It is responsible for coordinating and managing the authentication process within an application. The AuthenticationManager acts as a central point for authenticating user credentials and delegating the authentication process to the configured AuthenticationProviders.
* AuthenticationFilter: AuthenticationFilter is a component provided by the Spring Security framework in Java that intercepts incoming requests and performs authentication for those requests. It is responsible for extracting the user's credentials from the request, authenticating the user, and generating an Authentication object that represents the authenticated user. AuthenticationFilter typically sits in the authentication processing chain and is configured to intercept specific URLs or request patterns. When a matching request is received, the filter extracts the necessary authentication information, such as username and password, from the request and creates an Authentication object .The AuthenticationFilter then delegates the authentication process to an AuthenticationManager to verify the user's credentials. If the authentication is successful, the filter creates a fully authenticated Authentication object and attaches it to the current security context.
## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
1. scalability: session consumes server resources and limit scalability. As sessions are typically stored in memory, having a large number of active sessions can consume a significant amount of server memory.
2. performance: Sessions require server-side storage and retrieval of session data for each request, which can introduce overhead and impact performance, especially when the session data is large or complex.
3. session management: Sessions need to be managed properly to handle session expiration, invalidation, and cleanup. If not managed correctly, it can lead to session-related issues, such as expired sessions or orphaned sessions.
4. storage: Sessions require storage resources on the server to store session data, which can be a concern if the server has limited storage capacity.
5. Mobile and distributed environments: Sessions may not be suitable for mobile applications or distributed environments where clients can switch between different devices or servers.

Using JWT can overcome the disadvantages of low performance and large storage requirments and also suitable for distributed environments.
