## 2. A checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime. A checked exception must be handled either by re-throwing or with a try catch block, whereas an unchecked isn't required to be handled.

## 3. There can only be one finally block, and it must follow the catch blocks. If the try block exits normally (no exceptions occurred), then control goes directly to the finally block. After the finally block is executed, the statements following it get control.

## 4. If both catch and finally return, the receiving method will get the returned value from the finally block.

## 5. A checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime. A checked exception must be handled either by re-throwing or with a try catch block, whereas an unchecked isn't required to be handled.

## 6. Both throw and throws are concepts of exception handling in Java. The throws keyword is used to declare which exceptions can be thrown from a method, while the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code.

## 7. 

## 8. The finally block always executes when the try block exits. This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs.

## 9. Creational Design Pattern. Factory Pattern. Abstract Factory Pattern. Singleton Pattern. Prototype Pattern. ...Structural Design Pattern. Adapter Pattern. Bridge Pattern. Composite Pattern. ...Behavioral Design Pattern.

## 10. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system.

## 11. Create the private constructor to avoid any new object creation with new operator. Declare a private static instance of the same class. Provide a public static method that will return the singleton class instance variable.

## 12. In object-oriented programming, the openâ€“closed principle (OCP) states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
