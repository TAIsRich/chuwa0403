## 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?

Selenium is an open-source framework used for automating web browsers. It allows developers to write scripts that interact with web browsers, automating tasks like clicking buttons, filling forms, and extracting data. It is commonly used for web testing and can work with various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. In the context of YouTube, Selenium can automate tasks like uploading videos and managing playlists.

## 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?

Cucumber is not specific to YouTube but rather a popular open-source tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD) and acceptance testing of software applications. It enables collaboration between stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and business analysts, by providing a common language for describing and automating application behaviors.

In the context of YouTube, Cucumber can be used as a testing framework to define and execute test scenarios for YouTube-related functionalities. Test scenarios written in a human-readable format called Gherkin can describe the expected behavior of the YouTube application from a user's perspective. These scenarios can then be automated and executed against the YouTube application using Cucumber.

## 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?

JMeter is a widely used open-source tool for load testing and performance evaluation of web applications. It can be utilized to assess the performance and scalability of the YouTube platform by simulating user traffic and measuring system response under different load conditions.

## 5. what is unit-test?

A unit test is a type of software testing where individual components of a software application, such as functions or classes, are tested independently to ensure they function correctly in isolation. Unit tests are written by developers to catch bugs early and improve code quality. They help ensure reliability and maintainability of the software.

## 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

The complete lifecycle of a test case can be seen in three phases with the help of annotations.

**Setup:** This phase puts the the test infrastructure in place. JUnit provides class level setup (@BeforeAll) and method level setup (@BeforeEach). Generally, heavy objects like databse comnections are created in class level setup while lightweight objects like test objects are reset in the method level setup.

**Test Execution:** In this phase, the test execution and assertion happen. The execution result will signify a success or failure.

**Cleanup:** This phase is used to cleanup the test infrastructure setup in the first phase. Just like setup, teardown also happen at class level (@AfterAll) and method level (@AfterEach).


## 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Yes, the @BeforeAll method in JUnit should be defined as a class-level method, which means it should be declared as static.
Since the @BeforeAll method is executed before any instance of the test class is created, it needs to be declared as static to be accessible without an instance of the class. This allows it to perform setup tasks that are not specific to any particular instance but rather apply to the entire test class.

## 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

Mockito is a Java framework used for mocking and stubbing in unit testing. It creates mock objects to simulate real objects' behavior. Mockito simplifies writing focused unit tests by isolating dependencies. Limitations include no direct mocking of final classes/methods, no mocking of static methods, and complexities in complex object creation.

## 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

In the context of Mockito, @Mock and @InjectMocks are annotations used for dependency injection in unit testing.

**@Mock:** The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. It is typically used to mock the dependencies of the class under test. By annotating a field or parameter with @Mock, Mockito creates a mock instance that can be used in the test case.
```java
@Mock
private UserService userService;
```

**@InjectMocks:** The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject the mock objects created with @Mock into the class under test. It automatically injects the mock objects into the appropriate fields or constructor parameters of the test class.

```java
@InjectMocks
private UserController userController;
```

## 10. What is the stubbing?

Stubbing is a technique in unit testing where predetermined responses or return values are defined for specific method calls on mock objects. It allows developers to control the behavior of dependencies and create predictable test scenarios. Stubbing helps isolate the code under test and focus on verifying its behavior without relying on the actual implementations of the dependencies.

```java
// 创建一个模拟对象
UserService userService = Mockito.mock(UserService.class);

// 存根 - 为模拟对象的方法调用定义预期的行为
Mockito.when(userService.getUserById(1)).thenReturn(new User("John Doe"));

// 测试依赖于 userService 的代码
User user = myService.getUserDetails(1);

// 验证预期的行为
assertEquals("John Doe", user.getName());

```

## 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utility methods provided by the Mockito framework for matching and verifying arguments in method invocations on mock objects.

ArgumentMatchers are used to define the expected conditions for method parameters, allowing matching and verification during the expected behavior and verification of mock objects.

*Here are some examples of Mockito ArgumentMatchers:*

**any():** Matches any type of argument. For example: Mockito.when(mockObject.method(any(String.class))).thenReturn(value);

**eq(value):** Matches a specific value. For example: Mockito.when(mockObject.method(eq("value"))).thenReturn(result);

**isNull():** Matches null values. For example: Mockito.when(mockObject.method(isNull())).thenReturn(result);

**isNotNull():** Matches non-null values. For example: Mockito.when(mockObject.method(isNotNull())).thenReturn(result);

anyInt(), anyString(), anyBoolean(), and so on: Matches specific types of arguments. For example: Mockito.when(mockObject.method(anyInt(), anyString())).thenReturn(result);


## 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers

Hamcrest Matchers is a Java library used in conjunction with frameworks like Mockito to write expressive and readable assertion statements in tests. It provides a set of matchers that allow for more natural language-style assertions. Examples include equalTo(), is(), not(), containsString(), greaterThan(), lessThan(), and instanceOf(). Hamcrest Matchers enhance test code readability and maintainability by making assertions more clear and intuitive.

## 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

The @Spy annotation is used in Mockito to create a partial mock object. It allows you to create a real instance of a class while still having the ability to stub or verify specific methods of that object.

Here are the key differences between @Spy and @Mock:

**Partial Mocking:** With @Spy, you can create a partial mock object where some methods are real (not mocked) and some methods can be stubbed or verified. In contrast, @Mock creates a complete mock object where all methods are mocked by default.

**Real Object Behavior:** @Spy preserves the original behavior of the real object for non-stubbed methods. When a non-stubbed method is called on a @Spy object, it will execute the real implementation of that method. On the other hand, @Mock methods have no real implementation unless specifically stubbed.

**Object Initialization:** @Spy requires an existing object instance to spy on. It wraps the real object and allows you to intercept method calls. On the contrary, @Mock creates a new mock object instance.

**Verifying Method Calls:** When using @Spy, you can verify both real and stubbed method calls. With @Mock, you can only verify method calls on the mock object itself.
