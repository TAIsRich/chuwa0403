# Homework 12
## 2.  what is selenium(YouTube)?
Selenium is an open source framework used for automating web browsers. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to write automated test and perform browser automation tests.
1. selenium webdriver: An interface for interacting with web browsers. It allows users to simulate user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages and extracting data from web browsers.
2. Selenium Grid: It is a distributed testing framework that allows tests to be run on multiple machines and browsers in parallel. Selenium Grid is useful for running tests across different operating systems, browsers, and versions simultaneously, improving test efficiency and coverage.

3. Selenium IDE: It is a browser extension that provides a record-and-playback feature for creating simple Selenium tests. Selenium IDE is useful for beginners or for quickly generating basic test scripts.

4. Selenium Client Libraries: Selenium provides client libraries for various programming languages, allowing developers to write Selenium tests in their preferred language. These libraries provide classes, methods, and utilities for interacting with web elements and executing test scripts.

5. Browser Support: Selenium supports a wide range of web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge. It allows developers to automate tests on different browsers without making significant changes to the test scripts.
## 3.  what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
Cucumber is an open source framework that suport BDD. It provides a way for developers, testers to collaborate and define application behavior in a human-readable format. Cucumber allows the creation of executable specifications written in plain text format called Gherkin. 

Gherkin: It is a simple, domain-specific language used to describe the behavior of an application in a structured format. Gherkin uses a set of keywords (Given, When, Then, And, But) to define scenarios and steps.

Feature Files: Feature files are text files written in Gherkin syntax that describe the behavior of an application feature or user story. Feature files contain scenarios, which are individual test cases with step definitions.

Step Definitions: Step definitions are code implementations that bind the steps in feature files to the actual code that performs the corresponding actions. Step definitions are written in programming languages such as Java, Ruby, or JavaScript.

Test Execution: Cucumber executes feature files by matching the steps in the files with their corresponding step definitions. It runs the tests and generates detailed reports indicating the success or failure of each scenario.

Integrations: Cucumber integrates with various testing frameworks, such as JUnit or TestNG, for running tests and generating reports. It also integrates with other tools like Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
## 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
It is mainly used for stress testing, load testing and performance measurement of web applications. JMeter is written in Java and can be used to simulate heavy user loads and analyze the performance and behavior of an application under various scenarios.

Load Testing: JMeter allows you to simulate multiple concurrent users and generate heavy loads on web applications or APIs to test their performance and scalability. It can simulate various user actions like sending HTTP requests, submitting forms, uploading files, and measuring response times.

Distributed Testing: JMeter supports distributed testing where multiple JMeter instances can be set up on different machines to distribute the load and simulate a larger number of concurrent users. This helps in assessing the performance of the system under realistic conditions.

Protocols and Technologies: JMeter supports various protocols and technologies, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOAP, REST, JDBC, JMS, and more. It can handle different types of requests and interactions with web servers, databases, messaging queues, and other systems.

Test Plan Creation: JMeter uses a hierarchical structure called a "Test Plan" to organize and configure test scenarios. Test plans can be created using the JMeter GUI or by writing XML files manually. Test plans define the sequence of requests, parameters, assertions, and timers for executing test scenarios.

Reporting and Analysis: JMeter provides various reporting and analysis features to evaluate the test results. It generates comprehensive test reports, including response times, throughput, error rates, and other performance metrics. These reports help identify performance bottlenecks, server-side issues, and potential areas for optimization.

JMeter is widely used in the software industry for performance testing and benchmarking. It is flexible, extensible, and supports integration with other testing tools and frameworks. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, JMeter helps ensure that applications can handle expected user loads and perform optimally under stress conditions.

## 5.  what is unit-test?
Unit testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing individual units or components of a software system in isolation. A unit refers to the smallest testable part of an application, typically a single function, method, or class. The purpose of unit testing is to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected and produces the correct output given a set of inputs.
## 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
1. Set up, set expectations with mock response;
2. Execute: call the method you want to test.
3. Assert: check the result and verify that it's the exepected resuolt.
4. Verify: verify calls, like how many times called.
## 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes. 
## 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
Mockito is a popular open-source Java testing framework that provides support for creating mock objects in unit tests. It allows you to create and configure mock objects that mimic the behavior of real objects, enabling you to isolate and test specific components of your code in a controlled manner.

Mockito is a tools used to mock the function that is not going to be tested in a function. (my answer)

It cannot used on final, static, private methods.
## 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock used to create a mock object of a class or interface;

@InjectMocks used on the objects which includes the mock objects and will inject the mock objects into itself. The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject mock objects into the fields of the unit under test. When you annotate a field or a method parameter with @InjectMocks, Mockito will attempt to inject the mock objects created with @Mock into the fields of the class under test automatically.
The injection is done based on type matching, so the names of the mock objects and the fields in the class under test should match.

## 10. What is the stubbing?
Stubbing refers to the process of defining the behavior of a mock object in a test scenario. When you stub a method, you are specifying what the method should return or how it should behave when it is invoked during the test. This allows you to control the behavior of dependencies and focus on testing specific scenarios without relying on the actual implementation of those dependencies.

In the context of mocking frameworks like Mockito, stubbing is commonly used to set up the behavior of mock objects. You can specify the return value of a method, throw an exception, or perform custom actions when the method is called. This allows you to simulate different scenarios and test various code paths.
## 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utility methods provided by the Mockito mocking framework to specify the matching criteria for method arguments when stubbing or verifying method invocations on mock objects. These matchers allow you to define flexible argument matching conditions to capture a range of argument values or patterns during testing.

ArgumentMatchers can be used in conjunction with methods like when() for stubbing method behavior and verify() for verifying method invocations. They help you define more expressive and dynamic expectations on method arguments, making your tests more readable and maintainable.
## 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a set of matchers for creating expressive and readable assertions in your tests. It works well with testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito, allowing you to write assertions that are more human-readable and intuitive.
## 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Mock:

The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface.
The mock object created using @Mock is a complete replacement of the real object, and its behavior needs to be explicitly defined using Mockito's mocking capabilities (e.g., when(), thenReturn()).
By default, all methods of the mock object return default values (e.g., null, 0, false) unless specified otherwise.
The @Mock annotation is suitable when you want to create a mock object from scratch and define its behavior for the specific test case.

@Spy:

The @Spy annotation is used to create a partial mock object of a real class or object.
The spy object created using @Spy retains the behavior of the real object, and only specific methods that you choose to mock will have modified behavior.
By default, all methods of the spy object delegate to the real implementation unless you explicitly define the behavior using Mockito's mocking capabilities.
The @Spy annotation is useful when you want to partially mock an existing object, allowing you to verify and modify specific behavior while maintaining the original behavior of the object.
