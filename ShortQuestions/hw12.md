Q2  

Selenium provides a programming interface that allows you to control web browsers programmatically. It supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, and others. With Selenium, you can simulate user interactions with web pages, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating through different pages.

When it comes to YouTube, Selenium can be utilized to automate tasks related to YouTube, such as uploading videos, managing playlists, extracting data from YouTube pages, or performing actions on the YouTube website through automated scripts or tests.

Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers. Selenium can be used for various web testing and automation tasks, including testing web applications, scraping web data, and performing repetitive tasks on websites.


Q3  

Cucumber is an open-source testing framework that allows you to write tests in a human-readable format. It uses a plain-text, domain-specific language called Gherkin, which is designed to be easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Gherkin uses a structured syntax with keywords like Given, When, and Then to describe the behavior of an application in a clear and concise manner.


Q4  
JMeter is an open-source performance testing tool that is widely used for load testing, stress testing, and performance measurement of web applications. 

JMeter allows you to simulate a large number of users (known as virtual users) accessing a web application simultaneously. By configuring JMeter with test scenarios and parameters, you can generate a significant load on the application and measure its performance under heavy user traffic.


Q5  
A unit test is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the individual units or components of a software system. A unit refers to the smallest testable part of a program, typically a function, method, or class.

The purpose of unit testing is to isolate and test each unit in isolation to ensure it functions correctly. It helps identify bugs, errors, and flaws early in the development process, making it easier to locate and fix issues. Unit tests also provide a safety net during code refactoring or modification by ensuring that existing functionality remains intact.

Q6  
Test Class Initialization: JUnit initializes the test class before executing any tests. This involves creating an instance of the test class and preparing it for testing.

BeforeClass: This is a static method annotated with @BeforeClass that is executed once before any test methods in the test class. It is often used for setting up common resources or performing expensive setup operations that are shared among all tests.

Test Method Initialization: JUnit initializes each test method before executing it. This includes creating a fresh instance of the test class and preparing it specifically for the current test method.

Before: This is a non-static method annotated with @Before that is executed before each test method. It is commonly used for setting up test-specific resources or performing pre-test setup operations.


Q7  
Yes, the @BeforeAll method in JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter) should be declared as a static method at the class level. 

Q8  
Mockito is a popular open-source Java framework used for creating and using mock objects in unit tests. Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. Mockito simplifies the process of creating and interacting with mock objects, allowing developers to effectively isolate and test individual units of code.

Limited Support for Final and Static Methods: Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods, as well as static methods. This limitation arises due to the way Mockito works, relying on dynamic proxies and bytecode manipulation. However, there are workarounds for mocking such elements using other frameworks or techniques.

Limited Support for Private Methods: Mockito does not directly support mocking private methods. It encourages test-driven development practices where private methods are indirectly tested through the public methods that utilize them.

Requires Access to Source Code: Mockito requires the availability of the source code to create mock objects. If the code under test is dependent on external libraries or proprietary code without accessible source, creating mock objects can be challenging.

Dependency on Mockito Framework: Mockito is a framework-specific tool, and using it may introduce a coupling between your tests and the Mockito framework. While Mockito itself is widely adopted and has a strong community, it's important to consider the potential impact if you decide to switch to a different testing framework in the future.

Q9  
The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. It is typically applied to a field or a method parameter in a test class. When the test class is initialized, Mockito automatically creates a mock instance of the specified class or interface.

The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject mock objects into the fields of a test class. It identifies the fields in the test class that should be injected with the mock objects.

Q10  
Stubbing refers to the process of defining the behavior and return values of methods in a mock object. When you stub a method, you are essentially providing a predefined response or outcome for that method when it is called during a test.

Mocking frameworks like Mockito allow you to stub methods on mock objects to simulate specific behaviors and control the test conditions. By stubbing methods, you can isolate the code under test and focus on testing specific scenarios without relying on the actual implementation of the dependent objects.

Q11  
Mockito ArgumentMatchers, provided by the Mockito framework, are utility methods used to specify flexible and expressive matching criteria for method invocations on mock objects. ArgumentMatchers are used in conjunction with Mockito's verification and stubbing methods to define the expected arguments passed to a mocked method during test execution.

Q12
Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a collection of matchers for performing assertions and expectations in unit tests. It enhances the readability and expressiveness of test assertions by providing a rich set of flexible matching rules.

Hamcrest matchers can be used with various testing frameworks, including JUnit and Mockito, to create more descriptive and readable assertions. They allow you to express expected conditions in a more natural language-like syntax.

Q13  

@Spy is an annotation used to create a partial mock of a real object. It allows you to retain the original behavior of the object while selectively mocking certain methods.

The main difference between @Spy and @Mock is how they create and handle the objects:

@Mock: The @Mock annotation is used to create a fully mocked instance of a class or interface. It creates a completely new instance of the class and replaces all its methods with mock implementations. You define the behavior of the methods on the mock object using Mockito stubbing techniques.

@Spy: The @Spy annotation, on the other hand, creates a partial mock by wrapping an existing instance of a class. It keeps the original behavior of the real object, except for the methods that are explicitly stubbed using Mockito stubbing techniques. The non-stubbed methods behave just like the original object's methods.
