## q2

@Configuration is used to indicate that a class contains configuration methods that can be used to define beans. The @Configuration annotation is typically used in conjunction with @Bean annotations.

@Bean is used to indicate that a method produces a bean that should be managed by the Spring container. This method typically creates and returns an instance of a class that will be used as a dependency by other beans.

## q3

Using @ExceptionHandler annotation: You can define a method annotated with @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions for a particular controller or for the entire application. This method will be called when an exception of the specified type is thrown.

Using HandlerExceptionResolver: You can define a custom implementation of HandlerExceptionResolver to handle exceptions for the entire application. This approach is useful if you need more control over the exception handling process.

Using @ControllerAdvice with ResponseEntityExceptionHandler: You can extend the ResponseEntityExceptionHandler class and define a method annotated with @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions for a particular controller or for the entire application. This approach is useful if you need to handle exceptions in a RESTful way.

## q4

Add the Bean Validation API and a validation implementation (such as Hibernate Validator) to your classpath

Annotate the properties of your domain object with validation annotations

Use the @Valid annotation to trigger validation

@NotNull: Ensures that a value is not null.
@NotEmpty: Ensures that a value is not null or empty.
@NotBlank: Ensures that a string value is not null, empty, or whitespace.
@Min: Ensures that a numeric value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum.
@Max: Ensures that a numeric value is less than or equal to a specified maximum.
@Size: Ensures that a collection, map, or string value has a specified number of elements or characters.
@Pattern: Ensures that a string value matches a specified regular expression.
@Email: Ensures that a string value is a valid email address.

## q5

## q2

Spring is a popular Java framework for building enterprise web applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications, including support for dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, web development, and much more.

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that provides an opinionated approach to configuring and building Spring applications. It simplifies the development and deployment of Spring applications by providing defaults for many configurations and by including a set of pre-built tools and libraries.

Some of the benefits of using Spring Boot include:

Faster development: Spring Boot reduces the time and effort required to develop and deploy Spring applications by providing a set of defaults for configuration, pre-built tools and libraries, and automatic configuration of common components.

Simplified configuration: Spring Boot makes it easier to configure Spring applications by providing a set of sensible defaults for configuration, and by automatically configuring many components based on the classpath and environment.

Production-ready applications: Spring Boot includes a number of features that make it easier to develop and deploy production-ready applications, including health checks, metrics, and monitoring.

## q3

IOC stands for Inversion of Control, which is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns in software applications. It allows you to decouple components by moving the responsibility of creating and managing object instances from the application code to a container or framework. The container or framework is then responsible for creating and managing the object instances and injecting them into the appropriate components.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a key feature of IOC, which is a technique used to implement the pattern. It is a process of providing the dependencies of a class as parameters to its constructor or setter methods, rather than creating the dependencies within the class itself. This allows the class to be more flexible and easily testable, as it can be configured with different dependencies without requiring changes to the class itself.

## q4


@ComponentScan is an annotation in Spring Framework that is used to specify the base packages that should be scanned for Spring-managed components such as @Component, @Service, @Controller, and @Repository.

## q5

ou can use the <context:component-scan > element to specify the base package(s) to scan for Spring-managed components.

Spring will scan the com.example.myapp package and its sub-packages for components.

Alternatively, you can use the <context:annotation-config > element to enable support for annotation-driven configuration, which includes component scanning.

## q6


@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation provided by Spring Boot that combines three commonly used annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

## q7

Using XML configuration: You can define a bean in an XML configuration file using the <bean> element.

Using Java configuration: You can define a bean using a Java class annotated with @Configuration and @Bean annotations.

Using Component scanning: You can define a bean by annotating a class with @Component or any of its specializations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller), and letting Spring automatically discover and create the bean.


## q8

In Spring, the default bean name for a bean defined using @Component or any of its specializations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller) is the name of the class with the first letter in lowercase.

If you define a bean using the @Bean annotation without specifying a name, the default bean name will be the name of the method that creates the bean, with the first letter in lowercase.


## q9

The main difference between @Service and @Repository is that @Service is used to represent the business logic layer, while @Repository is used to represent the persistence layer.

In practice, there is no functional difference between using @Component, @Service, or @Repository annotations, as they are all processed the same way by Spring. However, using the appropriate annotation can help to provide better code organization and express the intent of the class more clearly.


## q10

In Spring, there are several annotations that can be used for injecting beans:

@Autowired: This annotation can be used to inject a bean automatically by type. It is a type of dependency injection.

@Qualifier: This annotation can be used along with @Autowired to specify the name of the bean to be injected.

@Resource: This annotation can be used to inject a bean by name or by type.

@Inject: This annotation is similar to @Autowired and can also be used to inject a bean by type. It is part of the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) specification.

## q11

Constructor Injection: In this type of injection, dependencies are injected through a class constructor. The constructor is called with the necessary dependencies when an instance of the class is created. Constructor injection can help to ensure that all necessary dependencies are provided when creating an object, and it can make it easier to write unit tests.

Setter Injection: In this type of injection, dependencies are injected using setter methods. Setter injection allows for more flexibility in terms of changing the injected dependencies at runtime. However, it can make it more difficult to ensure that all necessary dependencies are provided when creating an object.

Field Injection: In this type of injection, dependencies are injected directly into class fields. This is done using annotations such as @Autowired or @Inject. Field injection is the simplest and most convenient type of injection, but it can make it difficult to write unit tests since dependencies are not explicitly set in the constructor.

## q12

In Spring, when you have multiple beans of the same type and want to set one as the primary bean to be injected, you can use the @Primary annotation.

If no primary bean is set and there are multiple beans of the same type, Spring will throw an exception at runtime when attempting to inject the bean. To avoid this, you can use the @Qualifier annotation to specify which bean to inject.

## q13

BeanFactory is a lightweight container that provides basic bean management, while ApplicationContext is a more feature-rich container that provides advanced functionality for enterprise applications.

## q14

Singleton: This is the default scope in Spring. A singleton bean is created only once and is shared across the entire application context. All requests for the bean will return the same instance. To define a bean as singleton, we can use the @Scope annotation with the singleton attribute, or we can omit the scope annotation altogether.

Prototype: A prototype bean is created every time it is requested, so each time a new instance of the bean is returned. Prototype-scoped beans are not shared across the application context. To define a bean as prototype, we can use the @Scope annotation with the prototype attribute.

Request: A request-scoped bean is created once per HTTP request and is available only during that request. This scope is typically used for web applications. To define a bean as request, we can use the @Scope annotation with the request attribute.

Session: A session-scoped bean is created once per user session and is available throughout that session. This scope is also typically used for web applications. To define a bean as session, we can use the @Scope annotation with the session attribute.

```java
@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class MySessionScopedBean {
    // ...
}
```

## q15
In Spring, we can configure a bean using XML configuration. If the bean has dependencies or constructor parameters, we can pass them using the constructor-arg element or the property element.

```xml
<bean id="user" class="com.example.User">
  <property name="name" value="John" />
  <property name="age" value="30" />
</bean>
```

If the User class had a constructor that took two arguments, we could pass them using the constructor-arg element instead

```xml
<bean id="user" class="com.example.User">
  <constructor-arg value="John" />
  <constructor-arg value="30" />
</bean>
```

## q2

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates an application into three components:

Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: The view displays the data to the user and allows the user to interact with the application.
Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, handling user input and updating the model and view as necessary.

## q3

Front-Controller is a design pattern commonly used in web applications that aims to centralize the handling of incoming requests.

In the Front-Controller pattern, there is a single point of entry into the application, known as the front controller. The front controller is responsible for handling incoming requests and dispatching them to the appropriate controller or handler based on the request URL or other request parameters.


## q4

The DispatcherServlet is a central component of the Spring MVC framework and acts as the front controller for handling incoming requests.

When a request is received by the web server, it is first sent to the Servlet container, which looks up the mapping for the request URL and forwards it to the appropriate Servlet. In a Spring MVC application, the DispatcherServlet is the target Servlet for all requests.

Once the request is received by the DispatcherServlet, it performs the following steps:

Handler Mapping: The DispatcherServlet consults the configured HandlerMapping to determine which Controller or handler should handle the incoming request based on the URL or other request parameters.

Handler Execution: The DispatcherServlet calls the appropriate Controller or handler to process the request and produce a response. The Controller or handler can access the request parameters and other attributes through the Model and View objects.

View Resolution: The Controller or handler returns a logical View name or View object to the DispatcherServlet, which consults the ViewResolver to determine the actual View to use for rendering the response.

View Rendering: The DispatcherServlet calls the View's render method, passing it the Model object that contains the response data. The View generates the response content, which is then sent back to the client by the Servlet container.

Exception Handling: If any exceptions occur during the request processing, the DispatcherServlet delegates to the configured ExceptionResolver to handle them appropriately.




## q5

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology for building dynamic web pages using Java as the programming language. JSP pages can contain both static HTML content and dynamic content generated by Java code. JSP pages are compiled into Servlets, which are then executed by a Servlet container to produce the final HTML output.

ModelAndView is a class in the Spring MVC framework that represents both the data model and the view for a web request. It is used to pass data between the Controller and the View, and to specify which view should be used to render the response.

## q6

multiple HTTP requests.

HttpServlet: The HttpServlet is a base class for Servlets that handle HTTP requests and responses.

ServletContext: The ServletContext Servlet provides access to global information about the web application, such as initialization parameters, context attributes, and resources.

Filter: A Filter is a Servlet that can intercept requests and responses before they are handled by the target Servlet or JSP page, allowing for common processing to be centralized and reused.

RequestDispatcher: The RequestDispatcher Servlet provides a way to forward requests and include responses between different Servlets and JSP pages.

AsyncContext: The AsyncContext Servlet provides a way to handle long-running requests asynchronously, freeing up server resources to handle other requests in the meantime.


## q7

Apache Tomcat: Tomcat is a popular open-source web server and Servlet container that is widely used for deploying Java web applications. It is lightweight and easy to configure, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized projects.
