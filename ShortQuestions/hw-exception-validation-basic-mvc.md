## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

1. @ExceptionHandler: @ExceptionHandler is an annotation in Spring Framework that you can use to handle exceptions that occur in a Spring MVC controller. When an exception occurs during the processing of a request, Spring will look for an @ExceptionHandler method in the controller that can handle the exception.
2. @ControllerAdvice: @ControllerAdvice is an annotation in Spring Framework that allows you to define a global exception handler for your Spring MVC application. @ControllerAdvice is used to handle exceptions across the whole application, rather than handling them in individual controllers. It allows you to define a class that can be used to provide centralized exception handling for all controllers in your application.
3. @Resource: @Resource can also be used to inject a bean into another component. It can be used to inject a bean by name, and can be used in combination with the @Qualifier annotation to specify the desired bean.
4. @Inject: @Inject can be used for dependency injection in Spring. It is similar to @Autowired, but is part of the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) standard.
5. @Value: This annotation can be used to inject a value from a properties file, environment variable, or other external configuration source.
6. @NotNull: Used to ensure that a field is not null.
7. @NotEmpty: Used to ensure that a field is not empty.
8. @NotBlank: Used to ensure that a field is not blank (i.e., contains at least one non-whitespace character).
9. @Size: Used to ensure that a field's length is within a specified range.
10. @Min: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum value.
11. @Max: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is less than or equal to a specified maximum value.
12. @DecimalMin: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum value.
13. @DecimalMax: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is less than or equal to a specified maximum value.
14. @Digits: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value has a specified number of digits in total and a specified number
of digits after the decimal point.
15. @Email: Used to ensure that a field contains a valid email address.
16. @Pattern: Used to ensure that a field matches a specified regular expression.
17. @Configuration: @Configuration is an annotation used in Spring to indicate that a class defines one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime. In other words, @Configuration is used to mark a class as a source of bean definitions in a Spring application context.

## 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?

@Configuration and @Bean are annotations used for configuring and defining beans.

@Configuration is used to mark a Java class as a configuration class, which contains bean definitions that are used to
configure the application context. This annotation indicates that the class should be treated as a source of bean
definitions for the application context.

@Bean is used to indicate that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. It tells Spring that a
bean should be created, and the method returns the instance of the bean. The @Bean annotation can be applied to methods
within a @Configuration-annotated class or to methods in a class annotated with @Component or @Service.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
 
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

## 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

1. @ExceptionHandler: You can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation to handle exceptions in a Spring MVC controller. When
an exception occurs during the processing of a request, Spring will look for an @ExceptionHandler method in the
controller that can handle the exception.
2. HandlerExceptionResolver: You can implement the HandlerExceptionResolver interface to define a global exception
handler that can handle exceptions thrown by any controller in your application.
3. @ControllerAdvice: You can use the @ControllerAdvice annotation to define a class that can provide exception handling
for multiple controllers.
4. @ResponseStatus: You can use the @ResponseStatus annotation to define the HTTP status code to be returned when a
specific exception is thrown.
5. HandlerInterceptor: You can implement the HandlerInterceptor interface to intercept requests and handle exceptions
before they are processed by a controller.
6. @ControllerAdvice + @ExceptionHandler + ResponseEntity: You can use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler
annotations with ResponseEntity to handle exceptions and return a custom response entity with the appropriate HTTP status
code, headers, and body.

## 4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotations you know.

In Spring Framework, you can do validations using the javax.validation API, which is a part of the Java Bean Validation
framework. Spring provides support for this API through the spring-boot-starter-validation module. To perform validation
in Spring, you can use the @Valid annotation on a method argument or on a method return value. The @Valid annotation
tells Spring to perform validation on the associated object.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
        // create the user
        return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
    }
}
```

Validation annotations include:

1. @NotNull: Used to ensure that a field is not null.
2. @NotEmpty: Used to ensure that a field is not empty.
3. @NotBlank: Used to ensure that a field is not blank (i.e., contains at least one non-whitespace character).
4. @Size: Used to ensure that a field's length is within a specified range.
5. @Min: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum value.
6. @Max: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is less than or equal to a specified maximum value.
7. @DecimalMin: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is greater than or equal to a specified minimum value.
8. @DecimalMax: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value is less than or equal to a specified maximum value.
9. @Digits: Used to ensure that a numeric field's value has a specified number of digits in total and a specified number
of digits after the decimal point.
10. @Email: Used to ensure that a field contains a valid email address.
11. @Pattern: Used to ensure that a field matches a specified regular expression.

## 5. What is the actuator?

In the context of Spring Framework, the Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project that provides production-ready features to
help you monitor and manage your application. The Spring Boot Actuator exposes a set of HTTP endpoints and JMX beans that
allow you to monitor and manage your Spring Boot application. The endpoints provide a wealth of information about your
application, including health checks, metrics, and environment properties. The actuator endpoints can be accessed over
HTTP, JMX, or by using external monitoring tools.

Spring Boot Actuator include:
1. Health checks: The /actuator/health endpoint provides a simple health check that can be used to determine whether the
application is running correctly.
2. Metrics: The /actuator/metrics endpoint provides information about various application metrics, such as HTTP request
counts, response times, and memory usage.
3. Environment information: The /actuator/env endpoint provides information about the application's environment
properties, such as system properties and environment variables.
4. Logging: The /actuator/loggers endpoint provides the ability to view and configure logging levels for the application.

## 7. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Springboot?

Spring is a popular open-source framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive
programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring includes a number of
sub-frameworks such as Spring MVC for building web applications, Spring Data for working with data, Spring Security for
handling security concerns, and more.

Spring Boot is a Spring-based framework that provides an opinionated approach to building Spring applications. It is
designed to simplify the development and deployment of Spring-based applications by providing a set of pre-configured
defaults and conventions. Spring Boot eliminates the need for a lot of boilerplate configuration code that is typically
required when building Spring applications, thereby reducing the time and effort required for development and deployment.

Springboot benefits:

1. Faster development: With Spring Boot, you can build applications quickly and easily using a set of pre-configured
defaults and conventions. This eliminates the need for a lot of boilerplate code, allowing you to focus on your business
logic and features.
2. Simplified configuration: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration capabilities that eliminate the need for complex
configuration files. It also supports externalized configuration, allowing you to configure your application using
properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.
3. Embedded web server: Spring Boot comes with an embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), which makes it easy
to deploy your application without having to set up a separate web server.
4. Improved production readiness: Spring Boot provides production-ready features such as health checks, metrics, and
externalized configuration, which make it easier to manage and monitor your application in production.
5. Modular architecture: Spring Boot is designed to be modular, which means that you can pick and choose the modules that
you need for your application, without having to include the entire Spring framework.

## 8. What is IOC and What is DI?

In Spring, IOC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection) are two related concepts that are used to achieve
loose coupling between components and promote reusability and maintainability of code. 

IOC is a design pattern that allows the control of the flow of a program to be inverted or moved from the application
code to a framework or container. Instead of the application code creating and managing the objects it needs, the
framework takes over the responsibility of creating and managing objects, and provides them to the application code when
needed. 

DI is a specific implementation of the IOC pattern, where the framework or container injects the dependencies of an
object at runtime, instead of the object creating and managing its dependencies itself. This is achieved by passing the
dependencies to the object's constructor or by setting the dependencies as properties of the object after it is created.

Implement DI:
1. Constructor injection: The dependencies are injected through the object's constructor.
2. Setter injection: The dependencies are injected using setter methods.
3. Field injection: The dependencies are injected directly into the object's fields.

## 9. What is @ComponentScan?

@ComponentScan is a Spring annotation that is used to specify the packages to scan for Spring-managed components such as
@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, and others. When Spring bootstraps a new application context, it searches
for classes annotated with @ComponentScan and scans the packages specified in the annotation. It then registers any
Spring-managed components that it finds in those packages, making them available for use by other components in the
application.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.chuwa.mypackage")
public class AppConfig {
    
}
```

## 10. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

In Spring, you can specify the packages that need to be scanned for Spring-managed components using both XML
configuration and annotation-based configuration.

To specify package scanning in XML configuration, you can use the <context:component-scan> element. 

```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="com.chuwa.mypackage" />
```
To specify package scanning in annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.chuwa.mypackage")
public class AppConfig {
    
}
```

## 11. What is @SpringbootApplication?

@SpringBootApplication is a meta-annotation in Spring Boot that combines three other annotations: @Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

@Configuration marks the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the application based on its classpath and other
settings.
@ComponentScan tells Spring to scan the specified package and its sub-packages for Spring-managed components like
@Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
By combining these three annotations into a single meta-annotation, @SpringBootApplication provides a convenient way to
bootstrap a Spring Boot application.

## 12. How many ways we can define a bean?

1. Class level annotations: Beans can be defined at the class level using annotations like @Component, @Service
,@Repository, @Controller, and @ControllerAdvice. 

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    
}
```
2. Method level annotations: Beans can also be defined at the method level using the @Bean annotation. This is often used
in Java-based configuration classes.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```
3. XML configuration: Beans can be defined in an XML file using the <bean> element.

```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.chuwa.MyBean" />
```

## 13. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

The default bean name for @Component and @Bean annotations in Spring is derived from the name of the annotated class or
method, respectively.
For @Component, the default bean name is the uncapitalized non-qualified class name.
For @Bean, the default bean name is the name of the method that defines the bean.

## 14. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?

@Component, @Service, and @Repository are three stereotype annotations in Spring that are used to mark a class as a
Spring-managed component.

1. @Component: This is a generic stereotype annotation that can be used to mark any Spring-managed component. It can be used for any class that should be picked up by Spring's component scanning mechanism and managed by Spring's dependency injection container.
2. @Service: This is a specialization of @Component that is used to mark a class as a service layer component. A service layer is responsible for implementing business logic and processing requests from the presentation layer or the client. A typical service layer component performs a specific task or set of tasks and interacts with other components to complete the overall business process.
3. @Repository: This is also a specialization of @Component that is used to mark a class as a data access layer component. A repository component typically performs CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a database or other data store. It is responsible for managing the persistence of domain objects and retrieving them from the data store.

The main difference between @Service and @Repository is the layer of abstraction they represent. The service layer is concerned with business logic and high-level processing, while the data access layer is responsible for persistence and data retrieval.

## 15. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?

1. @Autowired: This is the most commonly used annotation for dependency injection in Spring. It can be used to inject a bean by type or by name. If multiple beans of the same type are available, the @Qualifier annotation can be used to specify the desired bean.
2. @Resource: @Resource can also be used to inject a bean into another component. It can be used to inject a bean by name, and can be used in combination with the @Qualifier annotation to specify the desired bean.
3. @Inject: @Inject can be used for dependency injection in Spring. It is similar to @Autowired, but is part of the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) standard.
4. @Value: This annotation can be used to inject a value from a properties file, environment variable, or other external configuration source.

## 16. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

1. Constructor Injection: This is a type of dependency injection where the dependencies are injected through the constructor of the class. This approach ensures that the object is fully initialized before it is used and provides better control over object creation. Constructor injection is considered the preferred method of dependency injection because it enforces the dependency requirements at the time of object creation and ensures that the object is fully initialized.
2. Setter Injection: This is a type of dependency injection where the dependencies are injected using setter methods.Setter injection provides more flexibility than constructor injection because the dependencies can be changed at runtime. However, it is generally considered less preferred than constructor injection because it makes the object partially initialized during construction and can make the object temporarily inconsistent.
3. Field Injection: This is a type of dependency injection where the dependencies are injected directly into the fields
of the class. Field injection is the easiest and most convenient way to inject dependencies, but it is generally
considered less preferred than constructor injection and setter injection because it makes the object partially
initialized during construction and can make the object temporarily inconsistent.

In general, constructor injection is considered the preferred method of dependency injection because it enforces the
dependency requirements at the time of object creation and ensures that the object is fully initialized. Setter injection
and field injection are generally used when constructor injection is not possible or when there is a need for more
flexibility in managing dependencies at runtime. However, it's important to note that the choice of injection type
depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application.

## 17. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.

You can use the @Primary annotation. The @Primary annotation is used to indicate that a particular bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are available. When Spring encounters multiple beans of the same type, it will automatically select the primary bean for injection.

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class PrimaryBean implements MyInterface {
    // implementation
}

@Component
public class SecondaryBean implements MyInterface {
    // implementation
}
```

If you don't want to specify a primary bean and prefer to let Spring pick one, you can use the @Qualifier annotation to specify which bean should be injected. The @Qualifier annotation is used at the injection point to specify the name of the bean to be injected.

1. Ambiguity resolution: If there are multiple beans of the same type and none of them are marked as primary, Spring will attempt to resolve the ambiguity by looking for a unique bean with the same name as the injection point.
2. Qualifier annotation: If there are multiple beans of the same type and you use the @Qualifier annotation on the injection point, Spring will look for a bean with the matching qualifier value.
3. Default naming: If there are multiple beans of the same type and none of the above mechanisms are used, Spring will look for a bean with a default name that matches the name of the injection point.

If there is no primary bean, no @Qualifier annotation and no default naming, then Spring will throw a NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException exception because it cannot determine which bean to inject.

## 18. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

The main difference between the two is that ApplicationContext is a sub-interface of BeanFactory, and thus provides additional functionality beyond what BeanFactory offers.

BeanFactory is the basic interface for managing and accessing Spring beans. It provides the basic functions of a Spring container, such as managing bean instances, creating and configuring beans, and handling dependencies between beans. BeanFactory is lightweight and provides lazy loading of bean instances. It is typically used in resource-constrained environments, where memory usage and startup time are critical.
ApplicationContext is a more advanced interface that extends BeanFactory and provides additional features. It provides support for internationalization, message sources, event publishing, and more. ApplicationContext eagerly loads all singleton beans at startup time and caches them for later use, so it can be slower to start up and use more memory than BeanFactory. ApplicationContext is the recommended interface to use in most applications.

Key differences:

1. BeanFactory provides basic container functionality while ApplicationContext provides advanced functionality.
2. BeanFactory is lightweight and provides lazy loading of bean instances while ApplicationContext eagerly loads all singleton beans at startup time.
3. BeanFactory is generally used in resource-constrained environments while ApplicationContext is recommended for most applications.
4. ApplicationContext provides additional features like internationalization, message sources, and event publishing, which are not available in BeanFactory.
5. ApplicationContext provides better support for AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and declarative transactions.

## 19. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

The scope of a bean in Spring defines how long the bean should live and how many instances of the bean should be created. The Spring framework provides several bean scopes to allow the developer to control the lifecycle of beans. The scope of a bean is specified using the @Scope annotation or the scope attribute in XML configuration.

1. Singleton: The default scope in Spring. Only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application context. This scope is suitable for stateless objects that can be shared safely across multiple threads. Example: DAO classes, Service classes.
2. Prototype: A new instance of the bean is created each time it is requested from the container. This scope is suitable for stateful objects that hold data specific to a particular user or request. Example: Form backing beans, stateful session beans.
3. Request: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request. This scope is suitable for beans that need to be created once per request and shared across multiple servlets or filters. Example: Controllers, Validators.
4. Session: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session. This scope is suitable for beans that need to maintain state across multiple requests within the same session. Example: Shopping cart, User session data.
5. Global session: Similar to the session scope, but the bean is scoped to the global HTTP session. This scope is suitable for beans that need to maintain state across multiple requests within a global HTTP session. Example: User preferences.
6. Application: A single instance of the bean is created for the entire application context. This scope is suitable for objects that need to be shared across multiple servlets or filters in a web application. Example: Cache manager, Application configuration.
7. WebSocket: A new instance of the bean is created for each WebSocket session. This scope is suitable for beans that need to maintain state across multiple WebSocket messages within the same session. Example: WebSocket message handler.

## 20. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 

1. Constructor injection using constructor-arg:
We can use the constructor-arg tag to inject dependencies through the constructor of a bean. The value attribute of the constructor-arg tag is used to set the value of the constructor parameter. If we want to inject another bean as a constructor parameter, we can use the ref attribute to reference the other bean.

```xml
<bean id="employee" class="com.chuwa.Employee">
  <constructor-arg value="Bowei" />
  <constructor-arg ref="address" />
</bean>

<bean id="address" class="com.chuwa.Address">
  <constructor-arg value="Main St" />
  <constructor-arg value="LA" />
  <constructor-arg value="USA" />
</bean>
```

2. Setter injection using property:
We can use the property tag to inject dependencies through setter methods of a bean. The name attribute of the property tag specifies the name of the setter method and the value attribute sets the value of the property. If we want to inject another bean, we can use the ref attribute to reference the other bean.

```xml
<bean id="employee" class="com.chuwa.Employee">
  <property name="name" value="Bowei" />
  <property name="address" ref="address" />
</bean>

<bean id="address" class="com.chuwa.Address">
  <property name="street" value="Main St" />
  <property name="city" value="LA" />
  <property name="country" value="USA" />
</bean>
```

3. Autowiring:
Autowiring allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into a bean. We can enable autowiring by setting the autowire attribute of a bean to "byName", "byType", or "constructor". Spring will then look for beans with matching names or types and automatically inject them.

```xml
<bean id="employee" class="com.chuwa.Employee" autowire="byName">
</bean>

<bean id="address" class="com.chuwa.Address">
</bean>
```

## 21. What is MVC pattern?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern used in software engineering to develop user interfaces. In the context of web applications, MVC is a popular architecture that separates an application into three interconnected components:

1. Model: The model represents the application's data and business logic. It interacts with a database or other data sources to manage and manipulate data.
2. View: The view is responsible for displaying data to the user in a meaningful way. It typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for rendering the user interface.
3. Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the user and sends it to the appropriate components. It also retrieves data from the model and updates the view accordingly.

The main idea behind the MVC pattern is to separate the concerns of an application into distinct components that are easier to manage and modify. By separating the concerns of an application, we can make our code more modular, testable, and maintainable. Additionally, MVC enables multiple views to reuse the same model, and it also allows different views to be swapped out without affecting the underlying data model or controller logic.

## 22. What is Front-Controller?

Front-Controller is a design pattern used in web development that provides a centralized point of control for managing requests and handling responses. In this pattern, there is a single controller that receives all incoming requests and then delegates the handling of those requests to other components within the application. In the context of web applications, the Front-Controller is typically implemented as a servlet that intercepts all incoming requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handler. The Front-Controller can also perform additional tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and exception handling.

Advantages:

1. The Front-Controller pattern is that it promotes a modular and extensible architecture for web applications. By centralizing request handling in a single component, it becomes easier to add new functionality or modify existing behavior without affecting the rest of the application.
2. Front-Controller pattern can improve security by providing a centralized location for handling security-related tasks such as authentication and authorization. It can also improve performance by caching responses and reducing the number of requests that need to be processed by the application.

## 23. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

DispatcherServlet is the core component of the Spring MVC framework and serves as the front controller for processing web requests. It intercepts incoming requests, delegates them to the appropriate handler, and then returns the response. When a request is sent to a Spring MVC application, it first goes through the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet acts as a centralized request handler and uses a set of configured handlers (known as "Controller" in Spring MVC) to process the incoming request.

The DispatcherServlet is typically configured through a web.xml file, which specifies a set of mappings between incoming URLs and the corresponding handler classes. Once the request is mapped to a specific handler, the DispatcherServlet passes the request along to the handler for processing. The handler then typically interacts with one or more service classes to perform business logic, such as accessing a database or performing a calculation. Once the handler has completed processing the request, it returns a ModelAndView object that contains the results of the request processing. The DispatcherServlet then renders the response by invoking a view resolver, which resolves the view that should be used to render the response. The view resolver maps the view name returned by the handler to an actual view, such as a JSP file or a Thymeleaf template, and then generates the response.

## 24. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web pages. It allows developers to embed Java code into HTML pages, which can then be compiled and executed on a web server to generate dynamic content. JSP is a server-side technology that is often used in conjunction with the Spring MVC framework to create dynamic web applications. It is commonly used for tasks such as generating dynamic HTML pages, accessing databases, and processing user input.

ModelAndView is a Spring MVC class used to represent the results of a request processing operation. It consists of two parts: a Model object, which contains the data returned by the handler, and a View object, which defines how that data should be rendered as a response. The Model part of the ModelAndView object contains the data returned by the handler, typically in the form of a Map or a custom Java object. This data can then be accessed by the view in order to render the response. The View part of the ModelAndView object is typically a JSP file or a Thymeleaf template, which defines how the data should be rendered as HTML. When the ModelAndView object is returned by the handler, the DispatcherServlet uses a view resolver to determine the appropriate view to use based on the view name specified in the ModelAndView object.
