## Design Instagram Optimization

### Query Optimization
Analyze and optimize frequently executed database queries to reduce latency and improve overall system performance. Identify slow-performing queries and utilize indexing, query rewriting, and query caching techniques to optimize their execution. Regularly monitor query performance using profiling tools and make necessary adjustments.

### Pagination
In search service and News feed service, we can use searchFeed(user_id, page_count, last_timestamp) API to implement pagination. The direct approach of sending a pageId and pageCount in the getFeed request to the server, specifying the starting page and the number of photos per page, is not suitable. This approach would lead to incorrect results because a user's feed is dynamic and constantly growing. If new posts are added between the first and second pages, the indexes of the returned photos would be misaligned.

### Data sharding
In Photo/Video service, database tables can be scaled up by using data sharding. Using Consistent Hashing to solve the problem of node redistribution.

## Design Youtube Optimization

1. Video Format Selection:
Based on the user's device capabilities, network conditions, and preferences, YouTube selects the appropriate video format (resolution, bitrate, encoding) for streaming.
Adaptive streaming techniques, such as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), may be used to dynamically adjust the video quality based on network conditions during playback.
2. Video Segmentation:
The selected video is divided into small, manageable segments, typically ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes in duration. Each video segment is encoded and saved in multiple quality levels (bitrates) to accommodate different network conditions and device capabilities.
3. Video Chunk Delivery:
The video segments are delivered to the user's device in the form of video chunks. The user's device fetches the initial video chunks from the CDN server and buffers them for playback.
4. Buffering and Playback:
The video player on the user's device begins playing the buffered video chunks. As the user watches the video, subsequent video chunks are fetched and buffered in advance to ensure smooth playback without interruptions.

## Design Twitter Optimization 

1. Request Optimization:
Employ HTTP compression techniques to reduce the size of HTTP responses and minimize bandwidth usage. 
Use HTTP/2 protocol to enable multiplexing and reduce the number of round trips required for loading resources.
Optimize client-side rendering by reducing the number of requests, minimizing JavaScript and CSS file sizes, and implementing lazy loading for images and media.
2. Real-time Updates and Notifications:
Utilize WebSocket or long-polling techniques to enable real-time updates of the Twitter feed and notifications.
Implement push notifications for activities like new tweets, mentions, direct messages, and followers to keep users updated in real-time.
