# Optimization for Designing Vending machine
## 1. Adding load balancers:
 - Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or resources, allowing the system to handle a higher volume of requests. By balancing the workload, a load balancer enables horizontal scalability, making it easier to add or remove servers as needed without disrupting the system's availability.
 - Load balancers ensure that if one server or resource fails, the traffic can be automatically redirected to other healthy servers. This improves the system's overall availability and prevents single points of failure, enhancing fault tolerance and minimizing downtime.
 - By distributing traffic evenly across multiple servers, a load balancer can optimize resource utilization and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. This leads to improved response times, reduced latency, and better overall performance for end users.

## 2. Using Denormalization to optimize database:
- By duplicating data and storing it in denormalized form, complex queries that involve joining multiple tables can be simplified. This can significantly improve the performance of read operations, as the database engine can fetch data from a single denormalized table instead of performing costly joins across multiple tables.
- Joins can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets. Denormalization can eliminate the need for joins altogether by including all the required data within a single table. This reduces the number of join operations and can result in faster query execution times.
- It's important to note that denormalization introduces redundancy, which can increase data storage requirements and complicate data modification operations.

## 3. Deploying multiple instances of the same serviceï¼š
- By deploying multiple instances of the same service, the system becomes more resilient to failures. If one instance goes down or experiences issues, the other instances can continue to handle requests, ensuring high availability. This redundancy improves fault tolerance and reduces the risk of a single point of failure.
- Multiple instances of the same service can handle a higher volume of requests and distribute the workload more evenly. Load balancers can be employed to distribute incoming traffic across these instances, optimizing resource utilization and improving system scalability. This allows the system to handle increased traffic and scale horizontally by adding or removing instances as needed.

## 4. Secure Payment Gateway: 
- Integrate a reliable and secure payment gateway that supports various payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or bank transfers. Ensure the payment gateway complies with industry standards for data security (e.g., PCI DSS) and offers strong encryption and fraud detection mechanisms.
