### 3 What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker
Resilience patterns are a type of of service archiecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. (fault tolerance patterns)

Commonly used resilience patterns:
- bulkhead pattern: The bulkhead pattern involves partitioning resources and isolating components to limit the impact of failures. It ensures that failures in one part of the system do not bring down the entire system by separating resources and executing components in their own bounded contexts.
- circuit breaker pattern: The circuit breaker pattern aims to prevent repeated execution of an operation that is likely to fail, thus reducing the load on the system. It monitors the failure rate and, when the failures exceed a certain threshold, the circuit breaker "trips" and subsequent calls to the operation are short-circuited, avoiding unnecessary execution.
