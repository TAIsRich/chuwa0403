## 2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies

Microservice Architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other microservices through lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST or messaging.

Components/Tools/Dependencies commonly used in a microservice architecture:

`Spring Boot`: A popular Java framework for building microservices. It provides a simplified and opinionated approach to developing microservices, including embedded servers, dependency management, and configuration.

`Service Discovery`: Tools like Eureka, Consul, or ZooKeeper help manage and discover microservices in a dynamic environment. They allow services to register themselves and provide a central registry for service discovery.

`API Gateway`: An entry point for client requests that routes and proxies them to the appropriate microservices. Examples include Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, or Kong.

`Load Balancer`: Used to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a microservice to improve scalability and availability. Popular load balancing tools include Ribbon, Nginx, or HAProxy.

`Circuit Breaker`: A pattern to handle failures and prevent cascading failures in a distributed system. Tools like Hystrix or Resilience4j provide circuit breaker implementations.

`Messaging Systems`: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Apache ActiveMQ are used for asynchronous communication between microservices. They enable loose coupling and provide scalability and fault tolerance.

`Distributed Tracing`: Tools like Zipkin, Jaeger, or OpenTelemetry help monitor and trace requests as they flow through multiple microservices. They provide insights into performance bottlenecks and help with troubleshooting.

`Containerization`: Technologies like Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm are commonly used to package and deploy microservices in isolated containers.

`Logging and Monitoring`: Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, Grafana, or Splunk are used for centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting in a microservice environment.

`Security and Authentication`: Spring Security, OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or Keycloak are used for authentication and authorization of microservices.

`Database Integration`: Each microservice typically has its own dedicated database, and popular databases used in microservices include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra.

`Continuous Integration and Deployment`: CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI help automate the build, test, and deployment processes for microservices.


## 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
`Resilience patterns` are a set of design patterns and techniques used to build resilient and fault-tolerant systems that can handle failures and gracefully recover from them. These patterns help improve the overall stability, reliability, and availability of a system, especially in distributed and microservice architectures.

One of the commonly used `resilience patterns` is the Circuit Breaker pattern. The Circuit Breaker pattern is a mechanism for handling and mitigating failures in a distributed system. It aims to prevent cascading failures and improve the overall fault tolerance of the system.

The Circuit Breaker pattern operates like an electrical circuit breaker. It monitors the calls to a remote service or a dependency and maintains a state based on the success or failure of those calls. When the number of failures reaches a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips and starts to short-circuit subsequent calls. Instead of allowing the calls to reach the failing service, the circuit breaker immediately returns a fallback response, such as a default value or an error message.

The `circuit breaker` state can be in one of three states:

`Closed`: In the closed state, the circuit breaker allows normal calls to pass through and monitors the response. If the response is successful, it continues to allow calls. However, if the response fails, the circuit breaker increments a failure counter.

`Open`: Once the failure threshold is reached, the circuit breaker switches to the open state. In this state, calls to the failing service are intercepted and immediately return the fallback response without even reaching the service. This helps to reduce the load on the failing service and prevent further failures.

`Half-Open`: After a certain period of time, the circuit breaker enters the half-open state. In this state, it allows a limited number of test calls to the failing service. If those test calls succeed, the circuit breaker switches back to the closed state, assuming the service has recovered. However, if the test calls still fail, the circuit breaker returns to the open state.

The `Circuit Breaker` pattern provides several benefits:

`Fault Isolation`: It prevents cascading failures by isolating the failing service and minimizing its impact on the rest of the system.

`Fail-Fast`: It allows for quick detection and response to failures, reducing the overall response time of the system.

`Fallback Behavior`: It provides a fallback mechanism to return default or cached responses when the circuit is open.

`Health Monitoring`: It monitors the health of remote services and can trigger alerts or perform additional actions based on the state transitions.

## 6. How to do service discovery?
Service discovery is the process of dynamically locating and accessing services in a distributed system. It enables services to find and communicate with each other without relying on hard-coded endpoints or configurations. There are several approaches to implementing service discovery, but one common method is to use a service registry.

Here's an overview of how service discovery can be implemented using a service registry:

`Service Registration`: Each service instance registers itself with the service registry upon startup. It provides information such as its hostname, IP address, port, and any other relevant metadata. The service registry stores this information.

`Service Discovery`: Clients that need to consume a service query the service registry to obtain the necessary information. They can use the service's name or any other identifier to look up the available instances. The service registry provides the client with the details of the available instances, such as their IP addresses and ports.

`Load Balancing`: If there are multiple instances of a service registered with the service registry, the client can use load balancing algorithms to distribute the requests among the available instances. This helps in achieving high availability and scalability.

`Health Checking`: The service registry can periodically check the health of registered service instances. If an instance becomes unavailable or unresponsive, it can be marked as unhealthy or removed from the registry. This ensures that clients do not route requests to unhealthy or failed instances.

`Dynamic Updates`: Service instances can dynamically register or deregister themselves with the service registry as they come online or go offline. This allows for seamless scaling and deployment of new instances without disrupting the overall system.

There are various tools and technologies available for implementing service discovery, such as Netflix Eureka, Consul, ZooKeeper, and Kubernetes. These tools provide features for service registration, discovery, load balancing, and health checking, making it easier to implement and manage service discovery in a distributed system.

## 7. What are the major components of Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used for building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications. It consists of several key components that work together to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performance messaging system. The major components of Kafka are:

`Kafka Cluster`: A Kafka cluster is a group of Kafka brokers that work together to provide the messaging infrastructure. Brokers are responsible for storing and serving the messages, and they form the backbone of the Kafka system. A cluster typically consists of multiple brokers distributed across different machines or nodes.

`Topics`: Topics are the channels or categories through which messages are organized and published in Kafka. They act as the storage abstraction for the messages. Producers publish messages to a specific topic, and consumers subscribe to one or more topics to consume the messages. Topics can be divided into multiple `partitions` for scalability and parallel processing.

`Producers`: Producers are the entities that publish messages to Kafka topics. They generate and send messages to Kafka brokers. Producers can specify the topic to which the messages should be published, and they can also provide a key for message partitioning if desired.

`Consumers`: Consumers are the entities that subscribe to Kafka topics and consume messages. They read messages from the topics and process them according to their requirements. Consumers can be part of a consumer group, where each consumer in the group reads from a specific `partition` of a topic, enabling parallel processing and load balancing.

`Consumer Groups`: Consumer groups are a way of scaling consumer processing in Kafka. A consumer group consists of multiple consumers that collectively consume messages from one or more topics. Each consumer in a group is assigned to a specific `partition`, and Kafka ensures that each message is consumed by only one consumer within the group. This allows for parallel processing of messages and load distribution.

`Kafka Connect`: Kafka Connect is a framework that enables easy integration of Kafka with external systems. It provides connectors that allow data to be ingested from external sources or exported to external sinks in a reliable and scalable manner. Connectors can be used to stream data from databases, message queues, or other systems into Kafka or vice versa.

`Kafka Streams`: Kafka Streams is a client library that allows building real-time streaming applications on top of Kafka. It provides an API for processing and analyzing data streams in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. With Kafka Streams, developers can perform data transformations, aggregations, filtering, and more on the streaming data.

## 8. What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?
In Apache Kafka, a partition is a fundamental unit of scalability and parallelism. It is a way of dividing a Kafka topic into multiple smaller, ordered, and immutable segments. Each partition is a linearly ordered sequence of messages that are appended in the order they are received.

Partitions provide several key benefits:

`Scalability`: By dividing a topic into multiple partitions, Kafka can scale horizontally across multiple machines or nodes. Each partition can be hosted on a separate broker, allowing for distributed storage and processing of messages. This enables Kafka to handle large amounts of data and high message throughput.

`Parallel Processing`: With multiple partitions, Kafka allows for parallel processing of messages. Different consumers can read from different partitions concurrently, enabling parallelism and load balancing. This allows for efficient and distributed processing of messages across consumer applications.

`Fault Tolerance`: Kafka provides replication of partitions for fault tolerance. Each partition can have multiple replicas distributed across different brokers. Replication ensures that if a broker fails or becomes unavailable, the data in the partition is still accessible and can be served from the replicas. This provides high availability and durability of messages.

`Ordering Guarantee`: Messages within a partition are strictly ordered. All messages with the same key will always go to the same partition, ensuring that messages with related data are processed in order. However, there is no global ordering guarantee across partitions in a topic.

## 9. What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?
`ZooKeeper` is a distributed coordination service that plays a critical role in Apache Kafka. It is used for managing and coordinating the various components and resources in a Kafka cluster. ZooKeeper provides a reliable and centralized infrastructure for distributed systems, ensuring coordination, synchronization, and fault-tolerance.

Here are the main uses of ZooKeeper in Kafka:

`Cluster Coordination`: ZooKeeper helps in coordinating the activities of multiple brokers in a Kafka cluster. It maintains information about the cluster's configuration, leader election, and membership changes. Brokers use ZooKeeper to register themselves, discover other brokers, and elect a leader for each partition.

`Topic Configuration`: ZooKeeper stores and manages metadata about Kafka topics, including their configuration, partition assignments, and the location of their leaders. This information is used by brokers and clients to determine how to produce and consume messages for a specific topic.

`Consumer Group Coordination`: ZooKeeper tracks the offsets of consumer groups in Kafka. Consumer groups use ZooKeeper to store their current position (offset) within each partition they are consuming from. This allows Kafka to provide fault-tolerant and scalable consumer group coordination.

`Controller Election`: ZooKeeper facilitates the election of a controller node in a Kafka cluster. The controller is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster, including partition leaders, preferred replica elections, and handling cluster-wide metadata changes. ZooKeeper ensures that only one broker is elected as the controller at any given time.

`Failover and Recovery`: ZooKeeper provides reliable and consistent storage for critical data in Kafka. It helps in handling failover scenarios by storing and synchronizing metadata, ensuring that the system can recover from failures and maintain consistency across the cluster.

## 10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?
In versions of Apache Kafka prior to 2.8.0, ZooKeeper is a required component and is tightly integrated with Kafka. ZooKeeper is responsible for managing metadata, coordinating brokers, and handling cluster-wide coordination and synchronization.

However, starting from Apache Kafka 2.8.0, a new feature called Kafka Raft Metadata Mode has been introduced. This feature allows Kafka to operate without a dependency on ZooKeeper. Instead, Kafka uses an internal Raft consensus protocol for metadata management and coordination.

## 11. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.
In Apache Kafka, the concept of Leader and Follower is related to the replication and fault-tolerance mechanism. Each partition in a Kafka topic is divided into multiple replicas, and one of the replicas is designated as the Leader, while the others are called Followers.

The Leader is responsible for handling all read and write requests for a particular partition. It receives messages from producers, appends them to the partition's log, and replicates the messages to the Follower replicas. The Leader also serves read requests from consumers, providing them with the most up-to-date data.

Followers, on the other hand, replicate the log data from the Leader. They receive the log entries sent by the Leader and apply them to their own replicas. The Followers stay in sync with the Leader by continuously fetching and applying the latest log entries.

The concept of Leader and Follower provides several benefits:

`High availability`: If the Leader replica becomes unavailable due to failure or maintenance, one of the Followers can be elected as the new Leader. This ensures that the partition remains available for read and write operations.

`Load balancing`: Multiple Followers can share the load of replicating and serving read requests. This helps distribute the read workload across multiple replicas and improves overall performance.

`Fault tolerance`: In case a Follower replica fails, the Leader and other Followers continue to operate without interruption. The failed Follower can be replaced by a new replica, ensuring data availability and durability.

## 12. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?
Topic replication is an important feature in Kafka that provides fault-tolerance, high availability, and durability of data. It involves creating multiple replicas of a topic's partitions and distributing them across different brokers in a Kafka cluster.

There are several reasons why topic replication is important in Kafka:

`Fault tolerance`: Replication ensures that if a broker or replica goes down, the data and its availability are not affected. The replicas can continue to serve read and write requests, and a new leader can be elected if the current leader fails.

`High availability`: With replicas distributed across brokers, Kafka ensures that even if some brokers become unavailable, the topic data is still accessible from other replicas. This prevents service disruptions and ensures continuous availability of data.

`Durability`: Replication provides data durability by storing multiple copies of data across different brokers. This protects against data loss in case of hardware failures, network issues, or other unforeseen events.

## 13. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?
In Kafka, a `consumer group` is a group of consumer applications that work together to consume messages from one or more Kafka topics. Consumer groups enable parallel processing and load balancing of messages across multiple consumers.

When a Kafka topic has multiple partitions, each partition can be consumed by only one consumer within a consumer group at a time. However, different partitions can be consumed by different consumers simultaneously. This allows for parallel processing and increased throughput.

Consumer groups have the following characteristics:

`Load balancing`: Kafka ensures that partitions within a topic are evenly distributed across the active consumers in a consumer group. This helps in achieving load balancing and efficient utilization of resources.

`Parallel processing`: By having multiple consumers within a consumer group, it is possible to process messages from multiple partitions concurrently. This enables parallel processing and improves the overall throughput of message consumption.

`Fault tolerance`: Kafka provides fault tolerance by allowing multiple replicas of a partition. If a consumer within a consumer group fails or becomes unavailable, Kafka automatically rebalances the partitions among the remaining consumers. This ensures that message processing continues uninterrupted.

`Scalability`: Consumer groups can be scaled horizontally by adding more consumers to the group. As the number of consumers increases, Kafka automatically redistributes the partitions, allowing for increased processing capacity.

## 15. Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.
Apache Kafka has gained popularity and is widely used in various real-world scenarios due to its high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable nature. Here are some of the common real-world usages of Apache Kafka:

`Messaging System`: Kafka can be used as a messaging system to decouple various components of a distributed system. It allows real-time, reliable, and scalable communication between different services and applications.

`Log Aggregation`: Kafka can serve as a centralized log aggregation platform, collecting logs from multiple sources and providing a unified and durable storage for logs. This is particularly useful in large-scale distributed systems, where logs from different components need to be consolidated for monitoring, analysis, and debugging purposes.

`Event Streaming`: Kafka is often used as an event streaming platform to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It enables the processing of continuous streams of data in real-time, allowing applications to react to events as they occur.

`Data Integration`: Kafka acts as a data hub for data integration scenarios, where data needs to be ingested from various sources, transformed, and delivered to multiple destinations. It enables efficient and reliable data movement between different systems, such as databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

`Microservices Architecture`: Kafka plays a vital role in building scalable and decoupled microservices architectures. It facilitates asynchronous communication and event-driven architectures, allowing microservices to communicate and react to events effectively.

`Metrics and Monitoring`: Kafka can be used to collect and store metrics data from various sources, such as application performance metrics, system metrics, and user activity data. This data can then be processed, analyzed, and visualized for monitoring and performance optimization purposes.

`IoT Data Processing`: With the growing popularity of IoT devices and sensors, Kafka can handle high volumes of real-time data streams from IoT devices. It allows the processing, aggregation, and analysis of sensor data, enabling real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and decision-making in IoT applications.

## 16. Describe partitioning key in Kafka.

In Apache Kafka, a partitioning key is a piece of metadata associated with each message. It is used to determine the partition to which the message will be written. When a producer sends a message to Kafka, it can optionally specify a partitioning key along with the message payload.

The partitioning key is important because it determines the ordering and distribution of messages across the partitions in a Kafka topic. Kafka uses a partitioning strategy to assign messages to partitions based on their keys. The partitioning strategy ensures that messages with the same key are always written to the same partition, guaranteeing order and allowing for efficient data retrieval.

Here are a few key points to understand about partitioning keys in Kafka:

`Determining the Partition`: The partitioning key is used by the Kafka producer to determine the partition to which a message will be written. The producer uses a partitioning algorithm, such as hashing or key-range mapping, to map the key to a specific partition.

`Message Ordering`: Messages with the same key are guaranteed to be written to the same partition in the order they were received. This ensures that related messages are processed in the correct order, maintaining data consistency and preserving dependencies between messages.

`Parallel Processing`: By using partitioning keys, Kafka allows for parallel processing of messages. Different partitions can be processed concurrently by multiple consumers, providing scalability and high throughput.

`Data Distribution`: Kafka evenly distributes messages across partitions based on the partitioning strategy. This helps in achieving load balancing and ensures that the data is distributed across the cluster, enabling horizontal scalability.

`Choosing a Partitioning Key`: The choice of a partitioning key depends on the requirements of the application. Ideally, the key should be selected in a way that ensures even distribution of messages across partitions and provides an efficient way to group related messages together.

`Key Considerations`: It's important to choose a partitioning key that has high cardinality to avoid data skew and hotspots. A high-cardinality key ensures that messages are evenly distributed across partitions.

## 17. What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?
The purpose of partitions in Apache Kafka is to allow for the horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data distribution in a Kafka cluster. Partitions are the building blocks of Kafka topics and serve several important purposes:

`Scalability`: Partitions enable horizontal scalability by distributing the data across multiple brokers in a Kafka cluster. Each broker can handle a subset of the topic's partitions, allowing for parallel processing and increased throughput. As the load on a topic increases, more brokers can be added to the cluster to accommodate the additional partitions and distribute the workload.

`Fault Tolerance`: Partitions provide fault tolerance in Kafka. Each partition is replicated across multiple brokers, creating a set of replicas. One replica is designated as the leader, and the others are followers. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition, while the followers replicate the data and act as backups. If a broker or partition fails, one of the followers can be elected as the new leader, ensuring that data remains available and processing continues uninterrupted.

`Ordering and Consistency`: Within a partition, messages are strictly ordered based on their offset. This allows Kafka to guarantee the order of messages within a partition, making it suitable for scenarios that require sequential processing or maintaining data consistency. Messages with the same partition key are always written to the same partition, ensuring that related messages are processed in the correct order.

`Parallel Processing`: Kafka consumers can read data from partitions in parallel. Each consumer group can have multiple consumer instances, and each instance can consume from a subset of the partitions. This enables parallel processing of messages, allowing for high throughput and efficient data processing.

`Data Retention`: Partitions also determine the retention policy for data in Kafka. Each partition has a configurable retention period, after which data is eligible for deletion. This allows for flexible data retention strategies, where different partitions may have different retention policies based on the importance or age of the data.

## 18. Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka.
RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka are both popular distributed messaging systems, but they have some fundamental differences in their design and usage. Here are some key differences between RabbitMQ and Kafka:

`Messaging Model`:

`RabbitMQ`: RabbitMQ is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and follows a traditional message queuing model. It focuses on reliable message delivery and supports various messaging patterns like point-to-point and publish-subscribe.
`Kafka`: Kafka is designed as a distributed streaming platform. It follows a publish-subscribe model where messages are published to topics and consumed by multiple consumers. Kafka's primary focus is on high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming.

`Data Persistence`:

`RabbitMQ`: RabbitMQ persists messages to disk by default to ensure reliable message delivery. It stores messages in queues and provides durability even in the event of server failures.
`Kafka`: Kafka is designed as a distributed commit log, where messages are stored in a durable and fault-tolerant manner. Kafka retains messages for a configurable period, allowing consumers to read and replay messages as needed. It can handle large volumes of data and provides high-performance disk-based storage.

`Scalability and Throughput`:

`RabbitMQ`: RabbitMQ is well-suited for traditional messaging scenarios with moderate message volumes. It provides good vertical scalability, where multiple instances of RabbitMQ can be deployed in a cluster to handle increased load.
`Kafka`: Kafka is designed for handling high-throughput and high-volume data streams. It excels in horizontal scalability, allowing for the distributed processing of data across multiple brokers. Kafka's partitioning and replication model enable it to handle millions of messages per second.

`Message Order`:

`RabbitMQ`: RabbitMQ guarantees message ordering within a queue. Messages are processed in the order they are received within a single queue.
`Kafka`: Kafka guarantees message ordering within a partition. Messages with the same partition key are always processed in the order they are written. However, ordering is not guaranteed across different partitions.

`Use Cases`:

`RabbitMQ`: RabbitMQ is commonly used in traditional enterprise messaging scenarios, such as task queues, RPC-style communication, and event-driven architectures. It is suitable for scenarios that require reliable message delivery, transactional processing, and traditional messaging patterns.
`Kafka`: Kafka is designed for real-time data streaming and processing. It is commonly used in scenarios like log aggregation, event sourcing, data pipelines, real-time analytics, and stream processing. Kafka is well-suited for building scalable, high-throughput, and fault-tolerant data streaming applications.

## 19. What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?
Kafka provides several guarantees to ensure reliable and fault-tolerant data streaming:

`Publish-Subscribe Messaging`: Kafka follows a publish-subscribe messaging model, where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to topics to consume those messages. Kafka ensures that all subscribed consumers in a consumer group receive the published messages.

`Fault-Tolerance`: Kafka is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It achieves fault-tolerance through replication. Each topic can be divided into multiple partitions, and each partition is replicated across multiple Kafka brokers (servers). If a broker goes down, the replicas can take over, ensuring continuous availability and durability of messages.

`Scalability`: Kafka is designed to handle high-volume and high-throughput data streams. It achieves scalability through partitioning. Each topic can be divided into multiple partitions, allowing for parallel processing and distributed storage of messages across multiple brokers. This enables Kafka to handle large amounts of data and support a high number of producers and consumers.

`Message Durability`: Kafka provides durable storage of messages. Messages published to Kafka topics are persisted on disk and can be retained for a configurable period. This allows consumers to consume messages at their own pace, replay messages, and handle temporary consumer failures without losing data.

`Message Ordering`: Kafka guarantees message ordering within a partition. Messages with the same partition key are always processed in the order they are written. However, ordering is not guaranteed across different partitions.

`Exactly-Once Semantics`: Kafka introduced the concept of exactly-once semantics, which ensures that messages are either processed exactly once or not at all. This guarantees that no duplicate or missing data is processed. Exactly-once semantics can be achieved by leveraging Kafka's idempotent producer and transactional consumer features.

## 20. What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?
An unbalanced cluster in Kafka refers to a situation where the distribution of partitions across brokers is uneven. It means that some brokers may have a significantly higher number of partitions assigned to them, while others may have fewer partitions. This can lead to performance issues, as well as potential resource constraints on heavily loaded brokers.

To balance the cluster, you can redistribute the partitions across the brokers to achieve a more even distribution. Kafka provides a mechanism called partition reassignment to accomplish this. Partition reassignment involves moving partitions from heavily loaded brokers to underutilized brokers, thereby achieving a more balanced distribution of partitions across the cluster.

Here are the general steps to balance a Kafka cluster:

`Determine the current partition distribution`: You can use Kafka's command-line tools or administrative APIs to inspect the current partition assignment and identify the brokers with high partition counts.

`Generate a new partition assignment plan`: Kafka provides a tool called kafka-reassign-partitions.sh to generate a new partition assignment plan. This tool takes into account the desired balance and generates a proposal for partition reassignment.

`Execute the partition reassignment`: Once you have the new partition assignment plan, you can execute it using the kafka-reassign-partitions.sh tool. This will trigger the partition reassignment process, and Kafka will start moving partitions based on the plan.

`Monitor the progress`: During the partition reassignment process, you should monitor the progress to ensure that partitions are being successfully moved and that the cluster is approaching a balanced state. Kafka provides tools to monitor partition reassignment progress.

`Verify the balance`: After the partition reassignment is complete, verify the new partition distribution to ensure that the cluster is balanced. You can again use Kafka's command-line tools or administrative APIs to inspect the partition assignment.

## 25. What is offset?
In the context of Apache Kafka, an offset is a unique identifier that represents the position of a consumer within a particular partition of a topic. It is essentially a sequential number assigned to each message within a partition. Offsets start from zero and increase incrementally as new messages are produced.

Offsets play a crucial role in Kafka's messaging model as they provide a way for consumers to track their progress and resume consumption from a specific point in the partition. Consumers can commit the offset they have processed, and upon restarting, they can start consuming from the last committed offset, ensuring they don't miss any messages.
