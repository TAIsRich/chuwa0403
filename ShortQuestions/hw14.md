# 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
## Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. Common resiliency patterns used in application development include the bulkhead pattern and circuit breaker pattern.
## The circuit breaker allows microservices to communicate as usual and monitor the number of failures occurring within the defined time period. If the failure count exceeds the specified threshold value, the circuit breaker will move to the Open state. If not, it will reset the failure count and timeout period.

# 4.  Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers
## What are the components of Microservices?
### Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration, IaC(Infrastructure as Code Conception), Cloud Infrastructure, API Gateway, Enterprise Service Bus, Service Delivery
## What is Eureka in Microservices?
### Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address. Eureka Server is also known as Discovery Server.
## What is docker in microservices?
### Docker generally provides a container environment, in which any application can be hosted. This is accomplished by tightly packaging both the application and the dependencies required to support it. These packaged products are referred to as Containers, and since Docker is used to doing that, they are called Docker containers. Docker, in essence, allows you to containerize your microservices and manage these microservices more easily.

# 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
## A load balancer works as a “traffic cop” sitting in front of your server and routing client requests across all servers. It simply distributes the set of requested operations (database write requests, cache queries) effectively across multiple servers and ensures that no single server bears too many requests that lead to degrading the overall performance of the application. A load balancer can be a physical device or a virtualized instance running on specialized hardware or a software process.
## Load balancers minimize server response time and maximize throughput. Load balancer ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to online servers Load balancers do continuous health checks to monitor the server’s capability of handling the request. Depending on the number of requests or demand load balancers add or remove the number of servers.

# 6.  How to do service discovery?
## There are two types of service discovery: Server-side and Client-side. Server-side service discovery allows clients applications to find services through a router or a load balancer. Client-side service discovery allows clients applications to find services by looking through or querying a service registry, in which service instances and endpoints are all within the service registry.
- 1) The Service Provider registers itself with the service registry when it enters the system and de-registers itself when it leaves the system.
- 2) The Service Consumer gets the location of a provider from the service registry, and then connects it to the service provider.
- 3) The Service Registry is a database that contains the network locations of service instances. The service registry needs to be highly available and up to date so clients can go through network locations obtained from the service registry. A service registry consists of a cluster of servers that use a replication protocol to maintain consistency.

# 7.  What are the major components of Kafka?
## The main Kafka components are topics, producers, consumers, consumer groups, clusters, brokers, partitions, replicas, leaders, and followers.

# 8.  What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?
## A partition in Kafka is the storage unit that allows for a topic log to be separated into multiple logs and distributed over the Kafka cluster. Partitions are the main method of concurrency for topics.

# 9.  What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?
## Zookeeper acts a Kafka cluster coordinator that manages cluster membership of brokers, producers, and consumers participating in message transfers via Kafka. It also helps in leader election for a Kafka topic.
## scalability issues,

# 10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?
## Yes, but we will miss some Zookeeper features.

# 11. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.
## Kafka has the notion of leader and follower brokers. In Kafka, for each topic partition, one broker is chosen as the leader for the other brokers (the followers). One of the chief duties of the leader is to assign replication of topic partitions to the follower brokers.

# 12. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?
## The purpose of adding replication in Kafka is for stronger durability and higher availability. We want to guarantee that any successfully published message will not be lost and can be consumed, even when there are server failures.
## An in-sync replica (ISR) is a broker that has the latest data for a given partition. A leader is always an in-sync replica. A follower is an in-sync replica only if it has fully caught up to the partition it's following. In other words, it can't be behind on the latest records for a given partition.

# 13. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?
## A consumer group is a set of consumers which cooperate to consume data from some topics. The partitions of all the topics are divided among the consumers in the group.

# 14. How do you start a Kafka server?
- 1: GET KAFKA
- 2: START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
- 3: CREATE A TOPIC TO STORE YOUR EVENTS
- 4: WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC - Producer
- 5: READ THE EVENTS - Consumer
- 6: IMPORT/EXPORT YOUR DATA AS STREAMS OF EVENTS WITH KAFKA CONNECT
- 7: PROCESS YOUR EVENTS WITH KAFKA STREAMS  
- 8: TERMINATE THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT

# 15. Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.
## Real-time Fraud detection: To continuously monitor user activities and detect any Fraudulent actions or patterns using Machine Learning Models. To alert appropriate consumer applications and teams in real-time.

# 16. Describe partitioning key in Kafka.
## A producer can use a partition key to direct messages to a specific partition. A partition key can be any value that can be derived from the application context. A unique device ID or a user ID will make a good partition key.

# 17. What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?
## Partitioning is what enables messages to be split in parallel across several brokers in the cluster. Using this method of parallelism, Kafka scales to support multiple consumers and producers simultaneously. This method of partitioning allows linear scaling for both consumers as well as producers.

# 18. Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka.
## Kafka is best used for processing streams of data, while RabbitMQ has minimal guarantees regarding the ordering of messages within a stream. On the other hand, RabbitMQ has built-in support for retry logic and dead-letter exchanges, while Kafka leaves such implementations in the hands of its users.

# 19. What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?
## fast, can handle larger data, and asynchronous 

# 20. What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?
## An unbalanced cluster can generate unnecessary disk, CPU problems or even the need to add another broker to handle unexpected traffic. The following constraints have to be kept in mind while rebalancing your cluster: Current distribution. Optimal selection of brokers.
## partition assignment algorithm is executed and decides what partitions should be claimed and claims the partition ownership in Zookeeper.

# 21. In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both?
## 

# 22. In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name?
## 

# 23. In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic.
## 

# 24. In your recent project, which team produce what kind of event to you and you producer what kind of events?
## 

# 25. What is offset?
## The offset is a unique ID assigned to the partitions, which contains messages. The most important use is that it identifies the messages through ID, which are available in the partitions. In other words, it is a position within a partition for the next message to be sent to a consumer.
