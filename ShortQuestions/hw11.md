# 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows people to modularize cross-cutting concerns in the code. It allows to define aspects, which encapsulate the behavior that should be applied across multiple modules or objects.
# 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:
- Spring AOP allows you to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and security, separately from the core business logic. This improves code organization and enhances the modularity of your application.
- Aspects defined in Spring AOP can be applied to multiple components or modules, reducing code duplication. This promotes code reusability and ensures consistent behavior across the application.
- By encapsulating cross-cutting concerns in aspects, Spring AOP reduces the amount of boilerplate code that would otherwise be scattered throughout your codebase. This leads to cleaner and more concise code.
- Spring AOP integrates seamlessly with the Spring Framework, making it easy to apply aspects to Spring-managed beans. It also supports integration with other AOP frameworks, such as AspectJ.
- Aspects defined in Spring AOP can be applied dynamically at runtime. This allows you to enable or disable aspects or modify their behavior without modifying the core application code.

Disadvantages:
- Spring AOP supports a subset of the pointcut expression language compared to the more advanced capabilities of AspectJ. This means that some complex join points or matching patterns may require the use of AspectJ instead.
- Spring AOP uses proxies to implement the aspect behavior, which means that the aspects are applied only to the Spring-managed beans and not to objects that are created outside the Spring container. This limitation may require additional configuration or customization in certain scenarios.
- The dynamic nature of Spring AOP, involving proxy creation and method interception, can have a slight performance impact compared to traditional method invocations.
- Spring AOP focuses primarily on method-level join points and has limited support for field-level join points.
# 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a modular unit of code that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. It defines the behavior that needs to be applied at certain join points in your application's execution flow. Aspects are used to add additional functionality to your application without modifying the core business logic.
An aspect consists of two main components: `Advice` and `Pointcut`.
# 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A pointcut is an expression that identifies specific join points in your application's execution flow where advice should be applied. It determines the locations in the codebase where the aspect's behavior should be invoked.
# 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A Join point represents a specific point in the execution flow of your application where an aspect can be applied. It is essentially a point in the code where the aspect's advice can be invoked.

Join points can correspond to various events or actions within your application, such as method invocations, exception handling, field access or modification, object instantiation, and more. Each join point is defined by a specific location in the codebase.
# 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice refers to the action or behavior that needs to be executed at specific join points in your application's execution flow. It represents the functionality that an aspect applies when it intercepts a join point. 

Types:
- `@Before` – Run before the method execution
- `@After` – Run after the method returned a result
- `@AfterReturning` – Run after the method returned a result, intercept the returned result as well.
- `@AfterThrowing` – Run after the method throws an exception
- `@Around` – Run around the method execution, combine all three advices above.
- `@Aspect` - indicate this is a aop class
- `@Component` - This annotation mark the beans as Spring's managed components
- `@Before` annotated methods run exactly before all methods matching with pointcut expression

# 10. When to use Spring Batch?
When we need to process a huge volume of data. 
# 11. How Spring Batch works?
- A `job` is the highest-level concept in Spring Batch. It represents a complete batch processing task with a defined start and end. 
- A job consists of one or more `steps`.	
- An `ItemReader` is responsible for reading input data for a step. 
- An `ItemProcessor` takes input from the `ItemReader`, performs some business logic or transformations on each item, and returns a processed item. 
- An `ItemWriter` is responsible for writing the processed items to the desired output, such as a database, file, or message queue. It receives the processed items from the `ItemProcessor` or directly from the `ItemReader` if no processor is specified.
- Spring Batch follows a chunk-oriented processing model, where items are processed in chunks rather than one by one.
- The `JobRepository` is a database or storage facility that maintains the state of each job and its steps. 
- The `JobLauncher` is responsible for starting and launching jobs.
- Spring Batch allows you to attach `listeners` and `interceptors` to various components of the batch processing flow. 
- Spring Batch integrates with Spring's transaction management capabilities.
- When executing a batch `job` in Spring Batch, the JobLauncher is used to start the job. The `JobRepository` keeps track of job and step executions, allowing for restartability and recovery in case of failures. Each step consists of an `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter` that work together to process data in chunks.
# 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
- `Spring Boot Scheduler`
- `Quartz Scheduler`
- `External Scheduler Integration`
# 13. What is the cron expression?
```
@EnableSchduling
@Scheduled(cron = "* * * * * *")
(Seconds Muinutes Hours DayofMonth Month DayofWeek)
```
# 14. What is the spring task?
The Spring Task Execution and Scheduling feature provides a way to schedule and execute tasks or methods at specified intervals or based on a cron expression. It offers a simplified approach to task scheduling without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

Spring Task consists: `Task Executor`, `Task Scheduler`. And we always use `@Scheduled` to do the scheduling execution.
# 15. When to use Spring task?
We can use Spring task in these situations:
- `Recurring Tasks`
- `Background Processing`
- `Timed Operations`
- `Asynchronous Execution`
- `Integration with Spring Ecosystem`
# 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
The role of the filter is when there are a bunch of requests, only the expected requests are expected to come in.

Filters can filter sensitive words (to prevent sql injection), set character encoding, URL-level permission access control, and compress response information
# 17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
Interceptors have the following functions:
- Login verification, to determine whether the user is logged in
- Permission verification, to determine whether the user has permission to access resources, such as verifying token
- Logging, recording request operation logs (user ip, access time, etc.), in order to count request visits
- Handles cookies, localization, internationalization, theming, etc.
- Performance monitoring, monitoring request processing time, etc.
# 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
- `preHandle()`: The preHandle() method is called before the execution of the controller method. It allows you to perform pre-processing logic on the request, such as authentication, logging, request validation, or setting up request attributes.

The preHandle() method returns a boolean value. By returning true, you indicate that the request should continue to be processed and proceed to the controller method. By returning false, you indicate that the request should be stopped and not further processed.
- `postHandle()`: The postHandle() method is called after the execution of the controller method but before the view is rendered. It allows you to perform post-processing logic on the model and view before they are sent to the client.

The postHandle() method receives the model and view as parameters, allowing you to modify them if needed. You can add additional data to the model, modify the view, or perform any necessary post-processing based on the results of the controller method.
# 19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source framework and a set of tools that help developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful APIs. It provides a standardized way to describe and document APIs using the OpenAPI Specification.

Swagger simplifies the process of designing, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It promotes API standardization, improves collaboration between frontend and backend teams, and enhances the developer experience by providing interactive documentation and code generation capabilities.
