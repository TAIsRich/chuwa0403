## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
AOP is a programming technique that supports the separation of cross-cutting concerns in order to increase modularity.

AOP is typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which implies that it defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut accross multiple types and objects.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
### Advantages:
1. easy to configure;
2. Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, separate compilation unit or class loader is not required.
3. It utilizes Spring's IOC container for DI.
4. Can create aspects using @Aspect annotation.
5. It integrates cross-cutting concerns into classes.

### Disadvantages:
1. Hard to debug.
2. Only method modified by public is recommended.
3. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. Once a class is marked as an aspect, spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.

## 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. It is a modular unit of cross-cutting functionality that is applied to multiple points in the application.

Advice: The actual functionality or behavior that you want to apply to the join points. It represents the cross-cutting concern you want to address, such as logging or security checks. There are different types of advice available in Spring AOP, including "before" advice (executed before a join point), "after" advice (executed after a join point), "around" advice (wraps a join point), and more.

Pointcut: Defines the specific join points in your codebase where the advice should be applied. It specifies the conditions or patterns that determine which methods or code segments are targeted by the aspect. For example, you can define a pointcut to match all methods in a specific package or all methods annotated with a certain annotation.

## 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A pointcut is an expression thta chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. 

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.

## 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice.

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is a powerful framework for building batch processing applications.

when: working with large amount of data, report generation.

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
1. Job configuration: This configuration includes defining steps, readers, writers, processors, and other components required for job execution.
2. Job execution: Joblauncher to launch a job. It receives a reference to the job and start working;
3. Job Execution Context: During job execution, Spring Batch maintains an execution context, which contains information about the job execution. This context can be accessed and modified by the various components within the job, allowing them to share data or communicate with each other.
4. Step Execution: A job is composed of one or more steps. Each step represents a specific unit of work within the job. Steps define the processing logic, including readers, writers, and processors. They can also include listeners to perform actions before or after step execution.
5. Item Reader: The batch processing starts with reading input data from a specified source. Spring Batch provides various built-in Item Readers, such as reading from a file, a database, or a message queue. You can also create custom Item Readers to read data from other sources.

6. Item Processor: After the data is read, it passes through an optional Item Processor. The Item Processor performs business logic, data transformations, validations, or any other processing on each item read from the input source. The output of the Item Processor is typically the processed or modified item.

7. Item Writer: The processed items are then passed to an Item Writer. The Item Writer is responsible for writing the processed items to a specified destination, such as a file, a database, or a message queue. Spring Batch provides various built-in Item Writers, and you can also create custom Item Writers to handle specific data storage needs.

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
Configure the Job: First, you need to define and configure your Spring Batch job using the JobBuilderFactory and StepBuilderFactory. Specify the steps, readers, processors, writers, and any other necessary components for your batch processing logic.

Create a JobLauncher: The JobLauncher interface is responsible for launching and controlling the execution of a job. You can create an instance of the JobLauncher, such as the SimpleJobLauncher, which is a basic implementation provided by Spring Batch.

Create a JobDetail Bean: In Spring, you can use the Quartz framework to schedule jobs. Define a JobDetail bean, which represents the details of the job to be executed. Set the JobLauncher and the specific job you want to execute as the target of the JobDetail.

Create a Trigger Bean: A Trigger specifies the scheduling configuration for a job. You can create a Trigger bean using the CronTriggerFactoryBean or SimpleTriggerFactoryBean, depending on your scheduling needs. Set the cron expression or the fixed delay/fixed rate for the Trigger.

Schedule the Job: Finally, use the TaskScheduler interface to schedule the job. The TaskScheduler executes the JobDetail at the specified intervals based on the Trigger configuration. Spring provides different implementations of the TaskScheduler interface, such as ThreadPoolTaskScheduler or ConcurrentTaskScheduler.

## 13. What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string representation of a schedule used to configure the timing and frequency of recurring tasks. It consists of five or six fields separated by spaces, representing different time elements. Each field corresponds to a specific aspect of the schedule, such as minutes, hours, days, months, and days of the week.

```<second> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week>```
