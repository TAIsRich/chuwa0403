## 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect Oriented Programming  
That is used for cross-cutting concerns. Cross-cutting concerns are the concerns that are needed through the entire application, like logging, security and data transfer.  
With AOP, we can execute extra methods when calling some specific methods.

## 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages of Spring AOP:
- Modularity: Spring AOP allows us to separate cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic, 
making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Code Reusability: AOP enables the reuse of common functionality across multiple classes and modules, 
reducing code duplication and promoting cleaner code organization.
- Loose Coupling: AOP enables loose coupling between components by allowing them to focus on their primary responsibilities. 
Cross-cutting concerns can be applied without modifying the core business logic.
- Improved Productivity: Spring AOP automates repetitive tasks, such as logging, security, and transaction management, reducing manual coding effort and improving developer productivity.  

Disadvantages of Spring AOP:
- Limited Pointcut Expressions: The pointcut expressions used in Spring AOP have certain limitations compared to more advanced AOP frameworks. 
It may not support all types of pointcut expressions or provide fine-grained control in complex scenarios.
- Complexity: AOP introduces an additional layer of complexity to the codebase, 
especially when dealing with complex pointcut expressions and multiple aspects. 
It may require a thorough understanding of AOP concepts and proper design to avoid potential issues. 
- Debugging and Troubleshooting: When issues arise in an AOP-enabled application, it can be more challenging to debug and troubleshoot, 
as the code execution flow may involve multiple interceptors and cross-cutting concerns. 

## 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
It's a modular unit that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns in an application. 
It defines certain actions to be executed at specific points, called joinpoints, in the code. 
Aspects help separate cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic, improving code modularity and reusability.

## 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
It defines the specific joinpoints in an application where an aspect should be applied. 
It is a way to specify which methods, classes, or other elements should be intercepted and have the advice from an aspect applied to them. 
Pointcuts use expressions to match specific joinpoints based on method signatures, class names, annotations, or other criteria.

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
It's a specific point in the execution of a program where an aspect can be applied. 
It can be a method invocation, object instantiation, exception handling, or other specific moments where an aspect's advice can be executed. 
Joinpoints allow aspects to intercept and modify the normal flow of execution.

## 8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
It can be action or behavior that is executed at a particular joinpoint. 
It represents the logic that is applied by an aspect at a specific point in the code.
1. Before Advice: Executed before a joinpoint, allowing to perform actions or setup tasks before the actual method invocation. 
2. After Returning Advice: Executed after a joinpoint successfully returns, allowing to perform actions based on the returned result. 
3. After Throwing Advice: Executed after a joinpoint throws an exception, allowing to handle or log the exception. 
4. After (Finally) Advice: Executed after a joinpoint, regardless of whether it completed successfully or threw an exception. This advice is typically used for cleanup tasks. 
5. Around Advice: Wraps a joinpoint, allowing to perform actions before and after the method.

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is used when we need to process large volumes of data efficiently in batch operations.   

It can be used for data import/export, data cleansing, report generation, and any repetitive data processing tasks that require scalability, fault tolerance, and transaction management. 

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
Spring Batch works by breaking down a large batch process into manageable chunks called "steps" and provides mechanisms to handle the execution, processing, and monitoring of these steps. 
The core components of Spring Batch include:
- Job: Represents the overall batch process to be executed. It consists of one or more steps and defines the flow and sequence of the steps.
- Step: Represents an individual unit of work within a job. It defines the processing logic and can include tasks like reading data, processing data, and writing data.
- ItemReader: Reads data from a data source, such as a file or database, and provides it as input for processing.
- ItemProcessor: Applies business logic or transformations to the input data obtained from the ItemReader. It can modify the data or filter out unwanted records.
- ItemWriter: Persists the processed data to a destination, such as a file or database.
- JobRepository: Manages the metadata about job and step execution, including storing job configurations, job status, and execution history.  

Spring Batch works in a step-by-step fashion, where each step reads data using the ItemReader, processes it using the ItemProcessor, and writes the results using the ItemWriter. 
The framework provides mechanisms for transaction management, error handling, and restartability to ensure the reliability and integrity of batch processing.
## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
We can schedule a Spring Batch job using various methods, including:
- Spring TaskScheduler: use Spring's TaskScheduler with cron expressions or fixed delay/interval to schedule the execution of a job at specific intervals or times.
- Quartz Scheduler: Spring Batch integrates with the Quartz scheduler, allowing us to define cron-based triggers or custom schedules to execute batch jobs.
- Spring Boot's `@Scheduled` Annotation: us this annotation to schedule the execution of a job method at specific intervals or times.
- External Scheduling Tools: use external scheduling tools like `Cron` or `Jenkins` to schedule the execution of a Spring Batch job by invoking a command or running a script that triggers the job.

## 13. What is the cron expression?
It is a string pattern used to define the schedule for **recurring** tasks in a **Unix-like** operating system.   
It consists of five or six fields that represent specific time elements, such as minutes, hours, days, months, and days of the week.   
Each field is separated by a space and can contain **numeric** values, **asterisks (*) as wildcards**, or special characters to specify the desired timing.

For example, a cron expression "`0 0 12 * * ?`" means that the task should be executed at _12:00 PM (noon) every day_. Here's a breakdown of the fields:
- Minute: 0 
- Hour: 0 
- Day of the month: 12 
- Month: *
- Day of the week: *
- Year: ?

## 14. What is the spring task?
With Spring Task, we can schedule the execution of methods or functions within the application based on fixed intervals, cron expressions, or specific time triggers. 
It simplifies the process of scheduling tasks and provides features like concurrency control, error handling, and flexible configuration options.

Spring Task is commonly used for running background jobs, periodic data updates, sending scheduled notifications, and other repetitive tasks in an application. 
It helps to automate tasks and improve the efficiency of the application by executing them at specified times or intervals without manual intervention.

## 15. When to use Spring task?
Use it when needing to schedule and execute tasks at fixed intervals or specific times within the application. 
It is suitable for case where we want to automate repetitive tasks, perform periodic data updates, schedule notifications or reminders, or run background jobs.  

Common examples:
- Regular data synchronization or data import/export processes.
- Generating reports or summaries at specific intervals.
- Sending scheduled notifications or reminders to users.
- Performing periodic maintenance or cleanup tasks.
- Running background jobs or batch processes.

## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
A filter is a component that intercepts and modifies the incoming request or outgoing response before it reaches the servlet or after it leaves the servlet.   
Filters provide a way to perform common pre-processing and post-processing tasks on web requests and responses.  
Examples:  
- Authentication Filter: Verifies if a user is authenticated before allowing access to protected resources. 
It checks for authentication credentials, such as tokens or session cookies, and redirects users to the login page if they are not authenticated.
- Logging Filter: Logs request and response information for debugging and auditing purposes. 
It captures details like request URL, request headers, response status, and can write them to logs or console.
- Compression Filter: Compresses response data to reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.
It compresses the response content, such as HTML, CSS, or JSON, and sets appropriate response headers to indicate the compressed format.
- Security Filter: Enforces security measures like protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. 
It can sanitize user input, validate requests, or add security headers to prevent malicious activities.
- Caching Filter: Implements caching mechanisms to cache frequently accessed resources. 
It intercepts requests, checks if the requested resource is already cached, and serves the cached version if available, reducing the load on the server.

## 17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
It is a component in web development that intercepts and processes requests and responses at various stages of the request lifecycle. 
Interceptors provide a way to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on web requests and responses similar to filters.  

What we can do with interceptors:
- Logging and Auditing: Interceptors can log request/response information, track user activities, or perform auditing tasks. 

- Authentication and Authorization: Interceptors can check if a user is authenticated and authorized to access certain resources. 

- Request Modification: Interceptors can modify the request parameters, headers, or body before it reaches the controller. 
They can add additional information, manipulate data, or perform data validation based on specific business rules.

- Response Modification: Interceptors can modify the response content, headers, or status before it is sent back to the client. 
They can add custom headers, transform response data, or handle error conditions in a uniform manner.

- Performance Monitoring: Interceptors can measure and monitor the performance of requests and responses. 
They can capture metrics like response time, resource usage, or API call counts to analyze and optimize application performance.

## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
They are methods that define the pre-processing and post-processing logic that happens before and after the execution of a controller method in Spring MVC.  
1. `preHandle`: It's executed before the actual method is invoked. 
It allows us to perform any necessary pre-processing tasks, such as logging, authentication checks, or request modifications. 
The `preHandle` method typically returns a boolean value to indicate whether the request should be further processed or should be stopped and a response should be returned. 
2. `postHandle`: It's executed after the method has been invoked but before the view is rendered. 
It allows to perform post-processing tasks on the model or view, such as adding additional data, modifying the response, or logging information. 
The `postHandle` method does not influence the execution flow of the request and does not have the ability to prevent further processing.

## 19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source framework that provides a set of tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.   
It offers a way to describe, document, and visualize APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.
