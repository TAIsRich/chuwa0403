## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
AOP is a programming technique that supports the separation of cross-cutting concerns in order to increase modularity.

AOP is typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which implies that it defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut accross multiple types and objects.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
### Advantages:
1. easy to configure;
2. Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, separate compilation unit or class loader is not required.
3. It utilizes Spring's IOC container for DI.
4. Can create aspects using @Aspect annotation.
5. It integrates cross-cutting concerns into classes.

### Disadvantages:
1. Hard to debug.
2. Only method modified by public is recommended.
3. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. Once a class is marked as an aspect, spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.

## 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. It is a modular unit of cross-cutting functionality that is applied to multiple points in the application.

Advice: The actual functionality or behavior that you want to apply to the join points. It represents the cross-cutting concern you want to address, such as logging or security checks. There are different types of advice available in Spring AOP, including "before" advice (executed before a join point), "after" advice (executed after a join point), "around" advice (wraps a join point), and more.

Pointcut: Defines the specific join points in your codebase where the advice should be applied. It specifies the conditions or patterns that determine which methods or code segments are targeted by the aspect. For example, you can define a pointcut to match all methods in a specific package or all methods annotated with a certain annotation.

## 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A pointcut is an expression thta chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. 

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.

## 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice.

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is a powerful framework for building batch processing applications.

when: working with large amount of data, report generation.

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
1. Job configuration: This configuration includes defining steps, readers, writers, processors, and other components required for job execution.
2. Job execution: Joblauncher to launch a job. It receives a reference to the job and start working;
3. Job Execution Context: During job execution, Spring Batch maintains an execution context, which contains information about the job execution. This context can be accessed and modified by the various components within the job, allowing them to share data or communicate with each other.
4. Step Execution: A job is composed of one or more steps. Each step represents a specific unit of work within the job. Steps define the processing logic, including readers, writers, and processors. They can also include listeners to perform actions before or after step execution.
5. Item Reader: The batch processing starts with reading input data from a specified source. Spring Batch provides various built-in Item Readers, such as reading from a file, a database, or a message queue. You can also create custom Item Readers to read data from other sources.

6. Item Processor: After the data is read, it passes through an optional Item Processor. The Item Processor performs business logic, data transformations, validations, or any other processing on each item read from the input source. The output of the Item Processor is typically the processed or modified item.

7. Item Writer: The processed items are then passed to an Item Writer. The Item Writer is responsible for writing the processed items to a specified destination, such as a file, a database, or a message queue. Spring Batch provides various built-in Item Writers, and you can also create custom Item Writers to handle specific data storage needs.

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
Configure the Job: First, you need to define and configure your Spring Batch job using the JobBuilderFactory and StepBuilderFactory. Specify the steps, readers, processors, writers, and any other necessary components for your batch processing logic.

Create a JobLauncher: The JobLauncher interface is responsible for launching and controlling the execution of a job. You can create an instance of the JobLauncher, such as the SimpleJobLauncher, which is a basic implementation provided by Spring Batch.

Create a JobDetail Bean: In Spring, you can use the Quartz framework to schedule jobs. Define a JobDetail bean, which represents the details of the job to be executed. Set the JobLauncher and the specific job you want to execute as the target of the JobDetail.

Create a Trigger Bean: A Trigger specifies the scheduling configuration for a job. You can create a Trigger bean using the CronTriggerFactoryBean or SimpleTriggerFactoryBean, depending on your scheduling needs. Set the cron expression or the fixed delay/fixed rate for the Trigger.

Schedule the Job: Finally, use the TaskScheduler interface to schedule the job. The TaskScheduler executes the JobDetail at the specified intervals based on the Trigger configuration. Spring provides different implementations of the TaskScheduler interface, such as ThreadPoolTaskScheduler or ConcurrentTaskScheduler.

## 13. What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string representation of a schedule used to configure the timing and frequency of recurring tasks. It consists of five or six fields separated by spaces, representing different time elements. Each field corresponds to a specific aspect of the schedule, such as minutes, hours, days, months, and days of the week.

```<second> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week>```

## 14. What is the spring task?
Spring Task is a part of the Spring Framework that provides support for task scheduling, including features such as method invocation timing and job scheduling. This is done through the TaskScheduler and TaskExecutor abstractions.

The TaskScheduler provides methods for scheduling tasks to run at fixed intervals or on cron-based schedules.

The TaskExecutor is an abstraction around task execution mechanisms. While it does not provide scheduling functionality, it does provide a simple method for executing tasks concurrently, allowing developers to control the threading details.

## 15. When to use Spring task?
Scheduled Tasks: If you have recurring tasks that need to be executed at fixed intervals or specific times, Spring Task provides a convenient way to schedule and automate these tasks. Examples include generating reports, sending notifications, performing data synchronization, or updating caches at regular intervals.

Batch Processing: When you need to process large volumes of data in batch mode, Spring Task can be used to schedule and execute batch jobs. You can define the tasks to read, process, and write data in chunks or batches, allowing you to efficiently handle complex processing requirements such as data imports, exports, or transformations.

System Maintenance: Spring Task is helpful for automating system maintenance tasks, such as performing backups, cleaning up temporary files, purging expired data, or running database maintenance scripts. You can schedule these tasks to run during low-traffic periods or at specific times to minimize the impact on system performance.

Data Synchronization: If you need to synchronize data between different systems or databases periodically, Spring Task can be used to schedule and trigger the synchronization tasks. This can include tasks like pulling data from external APIs, integrating with third-party systems, or synchronizing data across distributed systems.

Time-based Operations: Spring Task enables you to perform operations based on specific time conditions. For example, you can schedule tasks to run on a specific date, trigger reminders or notifications for events or deadlines, or activate or deactivate features based on predefined time-based rules.

Periodic Maintenance Tasks: Spring Task is useful for scheduling and executing periodic maintenance tasks, such as updating caches, refreshing configuration properties, or reloading application context. This ensures that your application remains up-to-date and performs optimally during its runtime.
## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
In the context of web applications, a filter is a component that intercepts and processes requests and responses before they reach the servlet or web resource. Filters are part of the Java Servlet API and provide a way to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on HTTP requests and responses.

Filters can perform a variety of operations, such as modifying request parameters, validating input, logging requests, implementing security measures, compressing responses, and more. They allow you to apply common functionality or behavior to multiple servlets or resources without duplicating code.

Authentication Filter: This filter checks if a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain resources or pages. If the user is not authenticated, they may be redirected to a login page.

Logging Filter: This filter logs information about incoming requests and outgoing responses. It can be used for debugging, monitoring, or auditing purposes.

Security Filter: This filter performs security-related tasks, such as checking for authorization, validating user roles or permissions, and enforcing access control rules.

CORS Filter: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter enables cross-origin requests by adding appropriate headers to the response. It allows resources on one domain to be accessed by web pages on another domain.

Compression Filter: This filter compresses the response data before sending it to the client, reducing the network bandwidth usage and improving the overall performance of the application.

Request Logging Filter: This filter logs detailed information about incoming requests, including request parameters, headers, and the execution time. It can be helpful for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

XSS Protection Filter: This filter protects against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing or escaping user input to prevent malicious script execution.

Rate Limiting Filter: This filter limits the number of requests from a client within a certain time period to prevent abuse or DoS attacks.

## 17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
In the context of web applications, an interceptor is a component that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses at various stages of their lifecycle. Interceptors are typically used in frameworks like Spring MVC and provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns to the request/response processing flow.

Here are some key points about interceptors:

Intercepting Requests: Interceptors can intercept incoming HTTP requests before they are handled by controllers or servlets. This allows you to perform pre-processing tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation, or request parameter manipulation.

Intercepting Responses: Interceptors can also intercept outgoing HTTP responses before they are sent back to the client. This enables you to perform post-processing tasks such as modifying the response content, adding headers, performing data transformations, or handling error conditions.

Multiple Interceptors: You can define multiple interceptors and specify their order of execution. This allows you to apply different interceptors to different sets of URLs or apply a common set of interceptors to all requests.

Handler Execution Chain: Interceptors work in conjunction with the handler execution chain. They can modify the request or response objects, invoke the next interceptor in the chain, or directly invoke the controller or servlet.

Customization and Extension: Interceptors provide a way to customize and extend the behavior of the application without modifying the core business logic. They encapsulate cross-cutting concerns and allow you to apply them consistently across multiple controllers or servlets.

Some common use cases for interceptors include:

Logging: Intercept requests and responses to log detailed information, such as request parameters, headers, execution time, or error conditions.
Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to protected resources.
Request/Response Modification: Modify request or response data, such as adding or removing headers, manipulating request parameters, or transforming response content.
Exception Handling: Intercept exceptions thrown during request processing and handle them centrally.

## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
In Spring MVC, the preHandle and postHandle methods are part of the HandlerInterceptor interface, which allows you to intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before and after the execution of the handler (controller method).

preHandle Method:

The preHandle method is invoked before the handler (controller method) is executed.
It allows you to perform pre-processing tasks and make decisions before the handler is executed.
It accepts three parameters: the current HttpServletRequest, the HttpServletResponse, and the handler object (controller method).
It returns a boolean value indicating whether the handler should be executed (true) or intercepted (false).
If preHandle returns false, the further execution chain (including the handler and subsequent interceptors) will be halted, and the response will be sent back to the client.
postHandle Method:

The postHandle method is invoked after the handler (controller method) is executed but before the view is rendered.
It allows you to perform post-processing tasks on the model and view, modify the response, or add additional attributes to the model.
It accepts three parameters: the current HttpServletRequest, the HttpServletResponse, and the handler object (controller method).
It does not return a value.
You can use this method to modify the response, log information, add custom headers, or manipulate the model before it's rendered by the view.

## 19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source framework that allows you to document, design, build, and consume RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a set of tools and specifications to describe and visualize APIs in a standardized way.

Swagger are:

OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification): It is a machine-readable format (in JSON or YAML) that describes the structure, endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, authentication methods, and other details of an API.

Swagger UI: It is a user-friendly, interactive interface that renders the OpenAPI Specification in a human-readable format. Swagger UI allows developers to explore and test APIs directly from their web browser. It provides documentation, sample requests, and response examples, making it easier to understand and interact with the API.

Swagger Editor: It is a web-based editor that allows developers to create, edit, and validate OpenAPI Specification files. It provides a real-time preview of the API documentation and helps ensure that the specification is valid and adheres to the Swagger/OpenAPI standards.

Swagger Codegen: It is a code generation tool that generates client SDKs (Software Development Kits) and server stubs based on the OpenAPI Specification. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it easier to consume or implement APIs by automatically generating code that integrates with the API.

The main benefits of using Swagger for API development are:

Documentation: Swagger provides a standardized way to document APIs, making it easier for developers to understand how to interact with the API and use its endpoints.

Visualization: Swagger UI provides an interactive interface that allows developers to explore and test APIs without the need for additional tools or clients.

Consistency: With the OpenAPI Specification, APIs can be described in a standardized format, ensuring consistency and clarity across different teams and projects.

Code Generation: Swagger Codegen simplifies the process of integrating with an API by automatically generating client code, reducing the development time and effort.

Collaboration: Swagger facilitates collaboration between different stakeholders (developers, testers, product owners, etc.) by providing a common language and documentation format for discussing API design and implementation.
