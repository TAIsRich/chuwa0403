### 3 Aspect Oriented Programming
AOP is a programming technique that supposrts the separation of cross-cutting concerns in order to increase modularity. We coudl add new functionality before or after a method is executed. 
### 4 Spring AOP pros & cons 
Advantanges:
- easy to configure. It si implemented in Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required. It utilizes Spring IOC container for dependency injection. It can create aspects using @AspectJ annotation or using XML based. 
- AOP provides a clear way to express cross-cutting concerns, making them more visible and transparent within the application's code base. 
- Modularity: AOP enables modular programming by separating cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic. Cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, transaction management, security, and caching, can be implemented as reusable aspects, which can be applied to multiple parts of an application without modifying the core code.
- AOP enables loose coupling between components. Aspects can be applied to target objects without the need of modify the target object's code explicityly.

Disadvantage:
- Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenging.
- Only methods with a public visibility wiill be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
- Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being autoproxied.
### 5 Aspect in Spring AOP
Aspect is the class to define all AOP self methods. It is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts.

### 6 Pointcut in Spring AOP
Pointcut is an expressiong to find all main application methods to insert advice.

### 7 Join point in Spring AOP
Join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.

### 8 Advice and advice's types in Spring AOP
Advice is an action that we take before or after the method execution. There are five types of advice in Spring AOP framework: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice. Advice is taken at a specific join point.

### 10 When to use Spring Batch
Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems. 

When users have to do a lot of batch processing, and during the night, there are no regular users using system. Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extramely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. 
### 11 How Spring Batch works
- Job configuration: configure the batch jobs, steps, readers, processors, writers, and other components using XML-based or Java-based configuration files.
- Job Execution: The execution of a batch job is initiated by a trigger. When a job is triggered, an instance of the job is created, and its metadata is stored in the JobRepository.
- Job and Step Execution: A job consists of one or more steps, each representing a specific unit of work within the job. During job execution, Spring Batch maintains an execution contest, which contains information about job execution. This context can be accessed and modified by the various components within the job. Steps define the processing logic, including readers, writers, and processors. They can also include listeners to perform actions before or after step execution.
- Item Reader: The ItemReader component reads data in chuncks or individually from a data source. It retrieves the data items and passes them to the ItemProcessor.
- Item Processor: The component receives each item read by the ItemReader and performs any necessary data transformation of business logic.
- Item Writer: It receives the processed items and persists them to a specified destination, such as a database or file.

### 12 How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job
- Configure the Job: First, you need to define and configure your Spring Batch job using the JobBuilderFactory and StepBuilderFactory. Specify the steps, readers, processors, writers, and any other necessary components for your batch processing logic.
- Create a JobLauncher: The JobLauncher interface is responsible for launching and controlling the execution of a job. You can create an instance of the JobLauncher, such as the SimpleJobLauncher, which is a basic implementation provided by Spring Batch.

- Create a JobDetail Bean: In Spring, you can use the Quartz framework to schedule jobs. Define a JobDetail bean, which represents the details of the job to be executed. Set the JobLauncher and the specific job you want to execute as the target of the JobDetail.

- Create a Trigger Bean: A Trigger specifies the scheduling configuration for a job. You can create a Trigger bean using the CronTriggerFactoryBean or SimpleTriggerFactoryBean, depending on your scheduling needs. Set the cron expression or the fixed delay/fixed rate for the Trigger.

- Schedule the Job: Finally, use the TaskScheduler interface to schedule the job. The TaskScheduler executes the JobDetail at the specified intervals based on the Trigger configuration. Spring provides different implementations of the TaskScheduler interface, such as ThreadPoolTaskScheduler or ConcurrentTaskScheduler.

### 13 cron expression
A cron expression is a string that represents a schedule or a pattern for defining recurring tasks in a Unix-like operating system. It is commonly used for scheduling jobs or tasks to be executed at specific times or intervals. A cron expresion consists of five or six fiels seprated by spaces, representing the schedule for minutes, hours, days of the month, monts, and days of the week, (a year field). 
### 14 Spring Task
Spring Task is a part of the Spring Framework that provides support fo the task scheduling, including features such as method invocation timing and job scheduling. This is done through the TaskScheduler and TaskExecutor abstractions. 
### 15 When to use Spring Task
- Scheduled Tasks: If you have recurring tasks that need to be executed at specific times or intervals, you can define methods annotated with @Scheduled and specify the cron expression.
- Asynchronous Operations: If you have to execute methods asynchronously, you can use @Async annotation. It don't need to block the main application thread.
- Background Processing: Spring Task is suitable for executing background processes that need to run continuously or for an extended period. For example, you might have a process that continuously monitors a message queue or performs regular data cleanup tasks. 
- Batch Processing: Spring Task can be used in conjunction with Spring Batch for executing batch processing jobs. While Spring Batch focuses on the actual processing logic and orchestration of batch jobs, Spring Task can handle scheduling and launching these jobs at specific times or intervals. 
- Application Startup Tasks: If you have specific tasks that need to be executed when your Spring application starts up, such as initializing the application's state, loading configuration, or performing data population, you can use the @PostConstruct annotation in combination with scheduling features.
- Time-Triggered Events: Spring Task is useful for triggering events or notifications based on specific times or intervals. You can configure scheduled tasks to send notifications, generate reminders, or trigger other actions based on the defined schedule. 

### 16 Filter and example
A filter is a component that intercepts and processes requests and responses between a web client and a web application. Filters are part of the Java Servlet API and provide a way to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on HTTP requests and responses.

Logging Filter: This filter logs information about incoming requests and outgoing responses. It can be used for debugging, monitoring, or auditing purposes.

Security Filter: This filter performs security-related tasks, such as checking for authorization, validating user roles or permissions, and enforcing access control rules.
### 17 Interceptor
Interceptor is a component that intercepts and processes HTTp requests and responses at various stages of their lifecycle. Interceptors are typically used in frameworks like Spring MVC and provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns to the request/response processing flow.

- Pre-processing: Interceptors can perform pre-processing tasks before the request reaches the controller. This can include tasks such as authentication, authorization, input validation, request parameter manipulation, logging, or setting up the execution context.
- Post-processing: Interceptors can perform post-processing tasks after the controller has handled the request and generated the response. This can include tasks such as modifying the response, adding additional data to the response, logging, or performing cleanup operations.
- Global Concerns: Interceptors provide a way to apply global concerns or cross-cutting functionality to multiple controllers or requests. 
- Modify Request or Response: Interceptors have access to the request and response objects, allowing you to modify or decorate them as needed. 
### 18 preHandle & postHandle
These are two methods defined in the HandlerInterceptor Interface, which allows to intercept and process HTTP request and responses in the request processing pipeline.

preHandle: executed before the controller handles the request.
postHandle: execute after the controller handled the request but before the response is sent to the client.
### 19 Swagger
Swagger is an open-source framework that allows you to document, design, build, and consume RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a set of tools and specifications to describe and visualize APIs in a standardized way.
