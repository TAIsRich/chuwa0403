Q1  
In Java, the keyword "volatile" can be used to declare a variable whose value may be modified by different threads. When a variable is declared as volatile, it guarantees that the variable's value will always be read from and written to the main memory, rather than from a thread's local cache.

This is important in multithreaded programs where multiple threads may access the same variable concurrently. Without the volatile keyword, it is possible for one thread to modify the value of a variable, but for another thread to read an outdated value from its local cache.

Q2  
1. Extend the Thread class
2. Implement the Runnable interface
3. Implement the Callable interface
4. Create a thread pool

Q3  
Return value:
Runnable does not have a return value, whereas Callable returns a value of the specified type. Callable's call() method is similar to Runnable's run() method, but it returns a value.

Throwing exceptions:
The run() method in Runnable does not throw any checked exceptions, whereas the call() method in Callable can throw checked exceptions.

Usage with Thread pools:
Runnable is commonly used with thread pools in Java, whereas Callable is less commonly used with thread pools. This is because thread pools are designed to execute tasks that do not return a value, and Callable's return value is not used by the thread pool.

Q4  
When you call t.start(), the JVM creates a new thread of execution and calls the run() method of the Thread instance on that new thread. The start() method returns immediately, allowing your code to continue executing while the new thread runs in parallel.

On the other hand, when you call t.run(), the run() method is executed on the same thread that called the run() method. There is no new thread created, and the run() method runs synchronously as a normal method call. This means that calling t.run() does not start a new thread of execution, and your code will not run in parallel with the run() method.

Q5  
Using the Thread class allows you to define a new thread by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method. This approach is simpler, as you don't need to define a separate class for the task to be executed by the thread. However, it has the disadvantage of not allowing you to extend any other class, as Java does not support multiple inheritance. Additionally, creating a new thread by extending the Thread class is not as flexible, since you cannot reuse the same thread object to execute multiple tasks.

On the other hand, implementing the Runnable interface allows you to define a task that can be executed by multiple threads. This approach is more flexible, as you can reuse the same Runnable object to execute multiple tasks, and it allows you to extend other classes in your code. However, it requires you to define a separate class for the task to be executed by the thread, which can be more complex than simply overriding the run() method.

In general, using the Runnable interface is considered to be a better approach for creating threads in Java.

Q6  
NEW: The thread has been created but has not yet started.

RUNNABLE: The thread is executing in the JVM, either on a CPU or waiting for a CPU to become available.

BLOCKED: The thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock to be released, which occurs when another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method on the same object.

WAITING: The thread is waiting for a specific condition to occur, such as a notification from another thread. This can occur when the wait() method is called on an object.

TIMED_WAITING: The thread is waiting for a specific condition to occur for a specific amount of time. This can occur when the sleep() or wait() method is called with a timeout.

TERMINATED: The thread has completed its execution and has exited.

Q7  
The wait() method is used to pause the execution of a thread and release the lock held by that thread until another thread notifies it to resume execution. It is typically used in multithreaded programs where one thread is dependent on another thread to complete its work before it can continue.

The sleep() method, on the other hand, is used to pause the execution of a thread for a specified amount of time. It is typically used to simulate a delay or to give other threads a chance to execute. The sleep() method does not release the lock held by the thread.

Q8  
Deadlock is a situation in computer programming where two or more processes or threads are blocked or waiting for each other to release a resource, preventing all of them from continuing their execution. In other words, a deadlock occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something.

Q9  
1. Shared Memory: Threads can communicate with each other by sharing memory. One thread can write data to a shared memory location, which can then be read by another thread. However, shared memory can also lead to synchronization issues and race conditions.

2. Message Passing: In message passing, threads communicate with each other by sending messages through a shared communication channel. This approach is often used in distributed systems and can be implemented using sockets or other communication libraries.

3. Synchronization Primitives: Synchronization primitives, such as semaphores, mutexes, and monitors, can be used to coordinate access to shared resources between threads. These primitives provide a mechanism for threads to wait for each other to release locks on shared resources before accessing them.

4. Signals and Interrupts: Signals and interrupts are mechanisms for one thread to notify another thread of an event or to request its attention. For example, a thread might send a signal to another thread to interrupt its execution and handle an urgent task.

5. Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs): In distributed systems, threads can communicate with each other by calling remote procedures. RPCs enable threads to call procedures on other machines as if they were local procedures.

Q10  
The join() method is a synchronization method used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before proceeding with the rest of the program. When a thread calls the join() method on another thread, it waits until that thread has finished executing before resuming its own execution.

Q11  
The yield() method is a thread control method that suggests to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor. 

Q12  
A thread pool is a common technique used in multi-threaded programming to manage a group of worker threads that are used to perform tasks concurrently. The thread pool provides a pool of pre-initialized worker threads that are ready to execute tasks as soon as they become available. This can improve the performance of applications that require frequent creation and destruction of threads by reducing the overhead associated with thread creation.

Q13  
The Executor Framework is a Java API that provides a standardized way to manage and execute tasks asynchronously in a multi-threaded environment. It provides a simple interface for submitting tasks for execution, managing the thread pool, and handling exceptions and results.

There are three main types of executors in the Executor Framework:

1. ThreadPoolExecutor: A ThreadPoolExecutor is a type of executor that maintains a pool of worker threads to execute submitted tasks. It is the most commonly used executor type and provides various configurable parameters such as the core pool size, maximum pool size, and queue size.

2. ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor: A ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor is a type of executor that allows for scheduling of tasks to run at specific intervals or times. It is commonly used for scheduling periodic or delayed tasks.

3. ForkJoinPool: A ForkJoinPool is a specialized type of executor that is designed for parallel processing of recursive algorithms. It divides a task into smaller sub-tasks and assigns them to worker threads in a divide-and-conquer fashion.

Q14  
shutdown() allows the executor to gracefully complete tasks that are already in progress, while shutdownNow() forcefully attempts to stop all tasks, potentially interrupting them and potentially leaving tasks incomplete.

Q15  
Atomic classes are a set of thread-safe classes that provide atomic operations on single variables, without the need for synchronization. 

Q16  
Concurrent Collections in Java are a set of thread-safe collection classes that provide high-performance access to shared data in a multi-threaded environment. They are designed to be used in situations where multiple threads need to access or modify a collection simultaneously, without the need for explicit synchronization or locking.

Q17  
1. ReentrantLock: This is a mutual exclusion lock that can be acquired by a single thread at a time. It provides more flexibility and features than intrinsic locks (synchronized blocks), such as fairness, interruptibility, and timed waiting.

2. ReadWriteLock: This is a lock that allows multiple threads to concurrently read a shared resource, but only one thread to modify it. It consists of two locks: a read lock and a write lock. Multiple threads can hold the read lock at the same time, but only one thread can hold the write lock.

3. StampedLock: This is a lock that supports optimistic locking and read/write locking modes. Optimistic locking allows multiple threads to read the shared resource concurrently, and only acquires a lock when it needs to write. This can improve performance in situations where reads are more common than writes.

4. Condition: This is a lock-based synchronization mechanism that allows threads to wait for a specific condition to be true before proceeding. It is used in conjunction with a lock, and provides methods for waiting, signaling, and broadcasting conditions.

5. ReentrantReadWriteLock: This is a lock that combines the features of the ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock. It allows multiple threads to concurrently read a shared resource, but only one thread to modify it.

Q18  
The main difference between object lock and class lock is that object lock is associated with a specific object instance, while class lock is associated with a specific class. 

Q19  
A Future is an interface that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows you to submit a task to an executor and retrieve its result when it's done, without blocking the calling thread. The Future interface provides methods to check whether the computation is complete, cancel the computation, and retrieve the result.

A CompletableFuture is a class that implements the Future interface and provides additional features for asynchronous programming. It allows you to compose multiple asynchronous operations into a pipeline of computations, and provides methods for combining, transforming, and handling the results of these operations.

Q20  
ThreadLocal is a class that provides a way to create thread-local variables. A thread-local variable is a variable whose value is local to the thread that accesses it, and is not shared with other threads. Each thread that accesses a thread-local variable has its own copy of the variable, which is independent of the copies held by other threads.、
