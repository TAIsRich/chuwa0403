## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please see annotations.md

## 2. What is the authentication?
Authentication in Spring involves verifying user identity using credentials and granting access to protected resources based on successful authentication.

## 3. What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources or functionalities based on a user's privileges, roles, or permissions. 

## 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Authentication is the process of verifying user identity, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access based on the authenticated user's privileges. Authentication establishes trust, and authorization enforces access control rules to protect resources and ensure secure system operations.

## 5. What is HTTP Session?
HTTP Session refers to a mechanism used in web development to maintain stateful communication between a web server and a client over multiple HTTP requests and responses. It allows the server to associate data with a specific user across multiple interactions.
## 6. What is Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the client-side (typically in the user's web browser) by a web server.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Sessions are stored on the server-side and offer larger storage capacity, secure storage, and centralized management. Cookies are stored on the client-side and have limited storage capacity, less secure storage, and can be managed by both the client and server.

## 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
- Session-based Approach:
When a user logs in or their session is initiated, store the user-specific information in the session object on the server-side. This can include user details, preferences, or any other relevant data.
Assign a unique session identifier (Session ID) to the user's session.
Send the Session ID to the client using a cookie or URL parameter.
In subsequent requests from the client, retrieve the Session ID from the cookie or URL parameter and use it to identify and retrieve the user's session data from the server-side session store.
Update or access the user information as needed throughout the application.
Ensure that the session has an expiration time, and manage session expiration and cleanup on the server-side.

- Cookie-based Approach:
When a user logs in or their session is initiated, store the user-specific information in a cookie on the client-side. This can be done by encoding the user information within the cookie value.
Set an expiration time for the cookie if it should persist beyond the current session. Otherwise, it can be a session cookie that expires when the browser is closed.
In subsequent requests from the client, retrieve the cookie value containing the user information sent by the browser.
Decode and access the user information from the cookie value within the server-side application.
Update or access the user information as needed throughout the application.
Ensure that sensitive data within the cookie is properly encrypted to maintain security.

## 9. What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a compact and self-contained JSON object.

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
In Spring Security, the Spring Security filter is a fundamental component that plays a crucial role in the authentication and authorization process. It is responsible for intercepting incoming requests and enforcing security measures based on the configured security rules and policies.

## 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
Token Generation, Token Verification, Token Utilization

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
Yes

## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security that is responsible for retrieving user-specific data from a data source. It typically fetches user details, such as username, password, and authorities, from a database or any other user repository.

AuthenticationProvider is an interface in Spring Security that handles the authentication process based on the provided user credentials.

AuthenticationManager is an interface in Spring Security that acts as a central point for handling authentication requests.

AuthenticationFilter is responsible for processing the authentication request and creating the Authentication object with user credentials.

## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Sessions typically require server-side storage to store session data. This can be a disadvantage when dealing with a large number of concurrent users or in distributed environments, as it can increase server load and resource consumption.

To overcome this, we need using distributed caching solutions or session clustering techniques. This allows session data to be distributed across multiple servers, improving scalability and reducing the load on individual servers.

## 15. how to get value from application.properties?
Using @Value annotation
Using Environment object
```
String myPropertyValue = environment.getProperty("my.property.key");
```

## 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is used to configure the security rules and access restrictions for different HTTP endpoints and resources. It allows you to define how incoming requests should be authenticated, authorized, and processed based on various criteria.

The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is used to configure the authentication mechanism and user details retrieval. It allows you to define how authentication should be performed and from where user details should be fetched.

## 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
In summary, authentication verifies the identity of a user, establishes their identity, and enables access to the application. Authorization determines the access privileges or permissions of the authenticated user and controls their ability to perform specific actions within the application.
