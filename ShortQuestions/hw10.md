## 1.  List all the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
See `ShortQuestions/annotations.md`

## 2.  What is the authentication?
Authentication is to verify the identity of a user to ensure they are who they claim to be

## 3.  What is the authorization?
Authorization is to grant or deny permissions to a user to do something

## 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Authentication is to verify the identity of user. Whereas authorization is to give an authenticated user the permission to do something

## 5.  What is HTTP Session?
An HTTP Session is to maintain stateful communication between a web server and a client over multiple requests.
It enables the server to associate data with a specific user or client and maintain that data throughout the user's interaction with the application.

## 6.  What is Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the client-side (user's browser) by a website. 
It is used to remember information about the user or track their activities across multiple requests and sessions.
Cookies provide a mechanism for websites to remember user preferences and maintain stateful information. 
They enable personalized experiences, such as remembering login status, language preferences, or customized content.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Sessions are server-side mechanisms for maintaining user-specific data and providing stateful interactions, 
while cookies are client-side storage for storing small pieces of data that can be accessed by the server or client-side scripts. 
Sessions rely on cookies to store and transmit session IDs, but the actual session data resides on the server. 
Cookies can be used independently of sessions for various purposes beyond session management.

## 8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
1. Create a Session:
   - When a user logs in or performs any action that requires session tracking, create a session on the server-side.
   - Generate a unique session ID for the user.
2. Store User Information in the Session:
   - Within the session, store the necessary user information as attributes.
   - This can include user ID, name, preferences, or any other relevant data.
3. Associate Session ID with Cookie:
   - To maintain session continuity, associate the session ID with a cookie on the client-side.
   - Set a cookie in the HTTP response header containing the session ID as its value.
   - The cookie will be stored on the client's browser.
4. Send the Cookie with Subsequent Requests:
   - As the user navigates through the application, the browser automatically includes the cookie with each subsequent request to the server.
   - The server can then retrieve the session ID from the cookie to identify the user.
5. Retrieve User Information from the Session:
   - On the server-side, retrieve the session ID from the cookie sent with the request.
   - Using the session ID, access the associated session object on the server.
   - Retrieve the stored user information from the session attributes.
6. Update User Information in the Session:
   - If the user updates their information during the session, modify the corresponding attributes in the session object.
   - Ensure that the updated information is stored in the session for future use.


## 9.  What is JWT?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, digitally signed token format used for securely transmitting information between parties. 
It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. 

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
In Spring Security, a filter is a component for authentication and authorization. 
Spring Security provides a set of filters that are organized in a filter chain to handle various security-related tasks.  

The Spring Security filter chain is responsible for processing incoming requests, enforcing security rules, and making decisions about allowing or denying access to protected resources. 
Each filter in the chain performs a specific security-related task, such as authentication, authorization, session management, CSRF protection, and more.  

Examples of common filters:  
- UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
- BasicAuthenticationFilter
- JwtAuthenticationFilter
- AccessDecisionManager
- ExceptionTranslationFilter

## 11. Describe how do JWT work
header.payload.signature  
header: contains the hashing algorithm that will be used  
payload: contains the claims or the JSON object  
Signature is used to verify the identity of the sender. Itâ€™s created using the algorithm mentioned in the header to hash the header, payload and secret key

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
SHA-256, SHA-512
## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
UserDetailsService retrieves user details, AuthenticationProvider performs authentication, AuthenticationManager manages the authentication process, and AuthenticationFilter intercepts requests and handles authentication. These components work together to authenticate users and enforce security in a Spring Security-enabled application.
## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Disadvantages:
- Server-side resource consumption: 
Sessions require the server to allocate and manage memory resources to store session data for each active user. 
This can lead to increased server load and memory usage, especially in applications with a large number of concurrent users.

- Scalability: 
Sessions can pose challenges when scaling an application horizontally across multiple servers. 
Each server needs to maintain its own session data, and synchronizing session state between servers can be complex.

- Storage limitations: 
Session data is typically stored in memory, which can impose limitations on the amount of data that can be stored per session. 
Large session data can impact performance and increase memory usage.  

To overcome:
- Stateless authentication: Instead of relying on server-side sessions, employ stateless authentication mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs carry all necessary user information and are self-contained, eliminating the need for server-side session storage.

- Distributed caching: Utilize distributed caching solutions like Redis or Memcached to store session data externally. This approach offloads the burden of session management from individual servers and allows for easier horizontal scaling.

- Client-side storage: Store session-related data on the client-side using techniques like cookies or local storage. This can reduce server-side resource consumption and improve scalability, as the server no longer needs to maintain session state.

- Short-lived sessions: Limit the duration of sessions to minimize server-side resource usage. Employ techniques like session timeouts or session invalidation upon user logout.
## 15. how to get value from application.properties?
We can access values from the application.properties file by using the `@Value` annotation or by using the `Environment` object. Here's how you can do it:
1. Using the `@Value` annotation:
```aidl
@Value("${property.key}")
private String propertyValue;
```
`property.key` is the key of the property you want to access in the `application.properties` file. Spring will inject the corresponding value into the `propertyValue` variable.
2. Using the `Environment` object:
```aidl
@Autowired
private Environment environment;

public void someMethod() {
    String propertyValue = environment.getProperty("property.key");
}
```
Autowire the `Environment` object and then call the `getProperty()` method with the key of the property you want to access.
## 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- `configure(HttpSecurity http)`: This method is responsible for configuring the security settings for various HTTP requests in the application. 
It allows us to define access rules, authentication mechanisms, and other security-related configurations.
- `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`: This method is used to configure the authentication mechanism for the application. It allows us to specify how user authentication should be performed, such as user details retrieval, password encoding, and authentication provider setup.
## 17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
- Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. In Spring Security, it involves validating the user's credentials (such as username and password) to ensure they are who they claim to be.
- Authorization: Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a certain action within an application. Spring Security provides a flexible and powerful authorization mechanism through the use of roles, authorities, and access control rules.
