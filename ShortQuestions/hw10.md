# q2

authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity accessing a system or application. Spring provides a comprehensive and flexible authentication framework called Spring Security, which enables developers to implement authentication mechanisms in their applications.

# q3

authorization is typically handled in conjunction with authentication using the Spring Security framework. Once a user is authenticated, Spring Security provides mechanisms for enforcing authorization rules based on the user's granted authorities or permissions.


# q4

authentication is about verifying the identity of the user, while authorization is about determining what the authenticated user is allowed to do within the system. Authentication establishes trust in the user's identity, while authorization controls and enforces access control rules to protect resources. 

# q5

HTTP Session is a mechanism used to maintain stateful communication between a web server and a client over the stateless HTTP protocol. HTTP itself is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request from a client to a server is independent and does not retain any information about previous requests.

# q6

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a web server to a user's web browser and stored on the user's device. It is a mechanism used to store information about the user's interactions with a website. When the user visits the website again, the browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing the server to remember certain information about the user.


# q7

sessions are server-side mechanisms used to maintain stateful communication and store user-specific data, while cookies are client-side storage mechanisms primarily used for tracking and maintaining stateful information. Sessions are stored on the server, while cookies are stored on the client's device. 

# q8

Session Usage:

When a user logs in or performs any action that requires persisting user information, create a session on the server-side and assign a unique session ID to it.
Store the necessary user information in the session object on the server. This could include user identifiers, roles, preferences, or any other relevant data.
Send the session ID back to the client, either as a cookie or as part of the response body.
On subsequent requests, the client's browser will automatically include the session ID in the request headers.
Retrieve the session ID from the request headers on the server-side.
Retrieve the corresponding session object associated with the session ID and access the user information stored in it.

Cookie Usage:

When a user logs in or performs any action that requires persisting user information, create a cookie containing the necessary user information on the server-side.
Set the cookie's attributes, including the expiration date, domain, and path, as appropriate for your application's requirements.
Send the cookie back to the client as part of the response headers.
On subsequent requests, the client's browser will automatically include the cookie in the request headers.
Retrieve and parse the cookie on the server-side to access the user information stored within it.


# q9


JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications and APIs.

# q10


In Spring Security, filters play a crucial role in handling various security-related tasks and processing HTTP requests and responses. Spring Security provides a collection of filters that are organized into a filter chain to enforce security measures and perform authentication, authorization, and other security-related operations.

# q11

JWT (JSON Web Token) works based on a simple and secure mechanism for transmitting information between parties. The typical flow of JWT involves three parties: the issuer (server), the client (user agent or application), and the resource server (protected API or service).

# q12

built-in PasswordEncoder interface provided by Spring Security. The PasswordEncoder interface abstracts the process of encoding passwords and provides secure and customizable implementations.

# q13

These components work together to provide authentication functionality in Spring Security. The UserDetailService is responsible for retrieving user details, the AuthenticationProvider performs the authentication process, the AuthenticationManager manages the authentication process, and the AuthenticationFilter handles incoming authentication requests and interacts with the AuthenticationManager.

# q14

Server storage: Sessions require server-side storage to store session data. This can become a scalability concern as the number of active sessions increases, as it requires allocating memory on the server to store session information.

Token-based authentication: Instead of relying heavily on sessions, use token-based authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth. These tokens can be self-contained and carry the necessary user information, reducing the need for server-side session storage.



# q15

To retrieve values from the application.properties file in a Spring application, you can make use of the @Value annotation or the Environment object provided by Spring Framework.

# q16

In a Spring Security configuration class that extends the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, the configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) methods play important roles in configuring the security aspects of your application.


# q17
Authentication:

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource.
In Spring Security, authentication involves validating user credentials (such as username and password) to ensure the user is who they claim to be.

Authorization:

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or functionality based on the authenticated user's permissions or roles.
Once a user is authenticated, authorization comes into play to determine what actions or resources they are allowed to access.
