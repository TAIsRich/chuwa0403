# 2. What is the authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It involves validating a user's credentials, such as a username and password.
The goal of authentication is to establish trust between the user and the system and to prevent unauthorized access.
# 3. What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system is allowed to access a particular resource or perform a particular action. It involves checking the permissions and privileges of a user or system to ensure that they have the necessary rights to perform the requested operation. The goal of authorization is to control access to resources and prevent unauthorized actions.
# 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
The main difference between authentication and authorization is that authentication is about verifying the identity of a user or system, and authorization is about determining what actions that user or system is allowed to perform.
# 5. What is HTTP Session?
HTTP Session is a mechanism provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to maintain state information about a user's interaction with a web application across multiple requests and responses. It allows the web server to associate a set of data with a particular user, typically identified by a session ID cookie that is sent back and forth between the server and the client.
# 6. What is Cookie?
Cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a web server to a web browser and is stored on the client's computer. Cookies are typically used to store user preferences, shopping cart items, and other information that can be used to identify the user and personalize their experience.
# 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
The main difference between cookies and sessions in Spring Security is that cookies are stored on the client side, while sessions are stored on the server side. Cookies are typically used to store small amounts of data that can be easily accessed by the client, while sessions are used to store larger amounts of data that need to be protected and managed by the server.
# 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
- When a user logs in to the application, create a new session object on the server side.
- Once the session object is created, store the user's information, such as their username, role, and permissions, in the session.
- To associate the session with the user's browser, send the session ID as a cookie in the HTTP response. The cookie should be set to expire after a certain period of time, such as a few hours or a day, to prevent unauthorized access.
- On subsequent requests, retrieve the session ID from the cookie and use it to retrieve the user's information from the session object on the server side.
- If the user's information changes, such as if they update their profile or add items to their shopping cart, update the session object with the new information.
- When the user logs out of the application, remove the session object from the server side and delete the session ID cookie from the client's browser.
# 9. What is JWT?
JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism that is commonly used in modern web applications. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. 
JWTs are typically used to authenticate users in web applications. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's identity and other information, such as their role or permissions. The JWT is then sent to the client, where it is typically stored in local storage or a cookie.
It offers a secure, scalable, and flexible way to manage user authentication and authorization.
# 10. What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security Filter is a set of Java Servlet filters that are provided by the Spring Security framework. These filters are responsible for handling the authentication and authorization of requests that are sent to a web application. They intercept incoming requests before they reach the application logic and perform security checks based on the configuration defined by the application.
Spring Security filters provide a powerful and flexible mechanism for implementing security in web applications, enabling developers to implement authentication and authorization with minimal effort.
# 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
- When a user logs in to a web application, the server generates a JWT containing the user's identity and other information, such as their role or permissions. The server then sends the JWT to the client.
- The client typically stores the JWT in local storage or a cookie, so that it can be sent back to the server with every subsequent request.
- When the client sends a request to the server, it includes the JWT as an HTTP Authorization header. The server then verifies the signature of the JWT to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
- If the JWT signature is valid, the server retrieves the user's identity and other information from the payload of the JWT.
- Based on the user's identity and other information, the server checks whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.
- If the user is authorized, the server sends back the requested data. If the user is not authorized, the server sends an error message.
# 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
In software development, it is common to use a password encoder to securely store and compare passwords in a database.
# 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
- `UserDetailsService` This interface is used to retrieve user details, such as their username, password, and roles, from a data source, such as a database or LDAP server.
- `AuthenticationProvider` This interface is responsible for authenticating a user given their credentials, such as their username and password.
- `AuthenticationManager` This interface manages a collection of AuthenticationProviders and delegates authentication requests to them.
- `AuthenticationFilter?` This is a servlet filter that intercepts incoming requests and attempts to authenticate the user based on the provided credentials.
# 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Using sessions in web applications consumes server memory, especially if the session data is large or there are many active sessions. This can lead to performance issues and may require additional server resources to handle the load.

By implementing strategies to reduce the amount of data stored in sessions, use short-lived sessions, implement session clustering, or use token-based authentication, these disadvantages can be mitigated.
# 15. how to get value from application.properties?
In a Spring application, we can use the @Value annotation to inject values from the application.properties file into our Java code.
# 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is used to configure how HTTP requests are secured by specifying which URLs are secured, which authentication mechanisms are used, and what roles are required to access certain resources. This method is responsible for defining the security policy of the application, by setting up security rules such as access control, CSRF protection, session management, and more.
- The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method, on the other hand, is used to configure how users are authenticated. This method is responsible for defining the authentication mechanism of the application, by setting up the user details service, and specifying the password encoder to use.
# 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
`Authentication` is the process of verifying the identity of a user, and ensuring that they are who they claim to be. Spring Security provides multiple authentication mechanisms, such as form-based authentication, HTTP basic authentication, and more.

`Authorization` is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a particular action. Spring Security provides various authorization mechanisms, such as role-based authorization, permission-based authorization, and more.
