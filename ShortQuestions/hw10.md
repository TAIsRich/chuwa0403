# 2. What is the authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person, device, or system. 
It usually involves validating some kind of credentials, like usernames, passwords, digital certificates, biometric data, or two-factor authentication codes.

# 3. What is the authorization? 
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources, services, or actions based on the authenticated identity of a person, device, or system. It is an essential part of access control and is used to ensure that only authorized users are allowed to access certain resources or perform certain actions.

# 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization? 
Authentication and authorization are two distinct concepts in the field of computer security and access control. Although they are related, they serve different purposes and play different roles in ensuring the security and integrity of a system.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or entity attempting to access a system, application, or resource. Its primary goal is to confirm whether the claimed identity is valid and belongs to the entity that it claims to be.

Authorization, on the other hand, comes after successful authentication. It is the process of granting or denying specific permissions, privileges, or access rights to authenticated users or entities. Authorization determines what actions or operations an authenticated user can perform and what resources they can access within a system.

# 5. What is HTTP Session? 
An HTTP session refers to a series of interactions between a web browser (client) and a web server. It allows the server to track and maintain stateful information about a user's interactions across multiple requests and responses.

# 6. What is Cookie? 
A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a user's computer or device by a website they visit. It is a commonly used mechanism for websites to remember and track information about users and their browsing activities. When a user visits a website, the website sends a cookie to the user's browser, and the browser stores it. The next time the user visits the same website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing the website to recognize the user and personalize their experience.

# 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie? 
The main difference between a session and a cookie lies in their purpose, storage location, and lifespan. While both are used for managing user information in web applications, they serve distinct roles. 

# 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
- Session Usage:
  - Store relevant user information (such as user ID, name, role, or preferences) in the session data on the server side
  - Generate a unique session ID and associate it with the session data.
  - Send the session ID to the client, typically by setting a cookie in the user's browser that contains the session ID.
  - Access the user information from the session data to personalize the user's experience or perform authorization checks.

- Cookie Usage:
  - Use cookies to store non-sensitive user information or user preferences that need to persist across multiple sessions or visits to the website.
  - Set cookies with an appropriate expiration date or make them persistent, depending on the desired lifespan of the information.
  - On subsequent visits, retrieve the cookies from the client's browser.
  - Access the information stored in the cookies to personalize the user experience or provide customized content.

# 9. What is JWT? 
JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs.

# 10. What is the spring security filter? 
Spring Security is a powerful and widely used security framework that provides comprehensive authentication, authorization, and access control capabilities for Java applications. It offers various features to secure web applications, RESTful APIs, and other types of applications.

# 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)?
1. Client -> Server: POST / authenticate with username and password
2. Server -> Server: Validate the username and password. Generate the JWT using secret key.
3. Server -> Client : Return the generated JWT.
4. Client: Saved on client side in local storage and cookie
5. Client -> Server: GET / hello with JWT in the header. 
6. Server -> Server: Validate JWT using secret key

# 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password? 



# 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
- UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security. It is responsible for retrieving user details from a data source, such as a database, to perform authentication.
- AuthenticationProvider is another interface provided by Spring Security. It plays a vital role in the authentication process. It receives the user details retrieved by the UserDetailsService and performs the actual authentication logic.
- AuthenticationManager is a core interface in Spring Security that orchestrates the authentication process.
- AuthenticationFilter, also known as the authentication entry point or login filter, is responsible for processing the authentication request and initiating the authentication process.

# 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage? 
- Server-side storage and scalability： Use session clustering or distributed caching mechanisms
- Resource consumption: Store only essential information in the session and avoid storing large objects or excessive data
- Stateless architecture: Design your application to be stateless and use token-based authentication mechanisms (such as JWT) instead of sessions

# 15. how to get value from application.properties? 
- Using the @Value annotation
- Using the 'Environment' object

# 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)? 
In Spring Security, the configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) methods play crucial roles in configuring security settings for your application

# 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization? 
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity accessing an application. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be. In Spring Security, the authentication process involves validating the user's credentials, such as a username and password, against a user repository or authentication provider.
- Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or operations based on a user's identity and associated permissions. It ensures that authenticated users have the appropriate privileges to perform certain actions or access certain parts of an application.
