Q2  
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It involves confirming that the user or system is who or what it claims to be, typically by requiring the user to provide some form of credentials, such as a username and password, a security token, or biometric data.

Q3  
Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. Authorization is based on the authenticated identity of the user or system, as well as the specific permissions or privileges associated with that identity.

Q4  
Authentication is about verifying identity, while authorization is about granting or denying access based on that identity.

Q5  
An HTTP session is a way of maintaining state between a web server and a web client (typically a browser) over a series of requests and responses. When a client establishes an HTTP session with a server, the server assigns a unique session ID to the client, which is typically stored in a cookie or in the URL. This session ID is used to keep track of the client's state across multiple requests and responses, allowing the server to maintain information about the client's interactions with the web application.

Q6  
A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a client (typically a browser) and that the client sends back to the server with each subsequent request. Cookies are used to store information about the client's interactions with the web application, such as user preferences, login information, or shopping cart contents. Cookies are typically stored on the client's device (e.g., in a browser's cookie jar) and can be read and modified by the server on subsequent requests.

Q7  
The main difference between sessions and cookies is where the data is stored. Session data is typically stored on the server, while cookie data is stored on the client's device. Sessions are typically used to store sensitive information, such as user authentication data, because they are more secure than cookies, which can be easily manipulated by the client. Cookies, on the other hand, are typically used to store non-sensitive information, such as user preferences or shopping cart contents, because they are easier to use and can be accessed more quickly than sessions. Another difference is that sessions typically expire after a period of inactivity or after a set time limit, while cookies can be set to expire at a specific time or after a certain number of visits.

Q8  
To use sessions or cookies to keep user information across an application, the server typically generates a unique identifier (session ID) for each user when they first access the application. This session ID is then stored either in a cookie on the client's device or in the URL. On subsequent requests, the server uses the session ID to retrieve the user's stored information and provide personalized content or services.

Q9  
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications, as they allow the server to encode user data in a compact and secure manner. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header and payload are encoded as base64 and concatenated with a period (".") separator, and the resulting string is signed using a secret key. JWTs are often used to replace traditional session-based authentication mechanisms, as they can be stored on the client-side and do not require server-side storage.

Q10  
Spring Security is a popular framework for implementing security in Java web applications. The Spring Security filter is a key component of the framework, responsible for intercepting incoming requests and applying security checks to them. The filter chain consists of a series of filters that are executed in a specific order, each responsible for a specific aspect of security, such as authentication, authorization, CSRF protection, or session management. The Spring Security filter can be configured using a variety of mechanisms, including XML, Java annotations, or the Spring Security DSL.

Q11  
The basic process for JWTs involves three steps: generating a token, sending the token to the client, and verifying the token on subsequent requests.

Q12  
It is generally recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm to store user passwords, rather than encoding them in plaintext. Password encoding is a reversible process, whereas password hashing is a one-way process that makes it difficult to retrieve the original password. Therefore, password encoding is not considered to be a secure method for password storage.

Q13  
- UserDetailsService: The UserDetailsService interface is used to retrieve user information (such as username, password, and authorities/roles) from a data source, such as a database or an LDAP directory. This interface provides a single method, loadUserByUsername(), which takes a username as input and returns a UserDetails object containing the user's information. The UserDetails object is used by Spring Security to perform authentication and authorization.
- AuthenticationProvider: The AuthenticationProvider interface is responsible for authenticating users based on their credentials (such as username and password). Spring Security supports multiple authentication providers, each of which can authenticate users using a different method, such as a database or LDAP directory. When a user attempts to log in, Spring Security will iterate through the registered AuthenticationProviders until one of them is able to authenticate the user.
- AuthenticationManager: The AuthenticationManager interface is responsible for managing the authentication process. It is responsible for delegating authentication to one or more AuthenticationProviders, and for returning an Authentication object if the authentication is successful. The AuthenticationManager is typically invoked by a filter in the request processing chain, such as the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.
- AuthenticationFilter: The AuthenticationFilter is a Spring Security filter that is responsible for processing incoming authentication requests. It intercepts the request and attempts to authenticate the user based on the provided credentials. If the authentication is successful, it creates an Authentication object and passes it to the AuthenticationManager for further processing. If the authentication fails, the filter can redirect the user to an error page or retry the authentication process.

Q14  
One disadvantage of using HTTP sessions is that they can consume server resources and may not scale well in distributed environments. Each session is typically associated with a unique identifier, which is stored on the server side and used to retrieve session data when necessary. This means that as the number of concurrent users increases, so does the amount of server memory required to store their session data.

Another disadvantage of sessions is that they can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as session hijacking and session fixation. In a session hijacking attack, an attacker steals a user's session ID and uses it to impersonate the user, while in a session fixation attack, the attacker sets a user's session ID before the user logs in, allowing the attacker to take control of the session once the user logs in.

To overcome the scalability issue, one approach is to use a distributed caching solution, such as Redis or Memcached, to store session data instead of relying on server memory. This allows session data to be shared across multiple server instances and can help improve scalability and performance.

To address the security vulnerabilities associated with sessions, it is recommended to use a secure session management strategy, such as using secure cookies to store session IDs and expiring sessions after a certain period of inactivity. Other strategies can include using SSL/TLS to encrypt session data in transit and implementing measures to detect and prevent session hijacking and fixation attacks. Additionally, using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) instead of sessions can provide a stateless and scalable approach to user authentication and authorization.

Q15  
Using the @Value annotation:
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    @Value("${my.property}")
    private String myProperty;
    //...
}
```
Using the Environment object:
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    @Autowired
    private Environment env;
    public void doSomething() {
        String myProperty = env.getProperty("my.property");
        //...
    }
}
```

Q16  
The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is responsible for configuring the security of HTTP requests. It allows you to specify which requests should be authenticated and which should be authorized, as well as the rules for how authentication and authorization should be performed. 

The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is responsible for configuring the authentication mechanism. It allows you to specify how users will be authenticated, such as using an in-memory user store, a database, or an external authentication provider.

Q17  
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable security framework that provides both authentication and authorization functionality for Java applications.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application. Spring Security provides various authentication mechanisms such as form-based authentication, basic authentication, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. These mechanisms can be configured to authenticate users against an in-memory user store, a database, or an external authentication provider.

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the authenticated user's role or permissions. Spring Security provides various authorization mechanisms such as URL-based authorization, method-level authorization, and expression-based access control. These mechanisms can be used to restrict access to certain parts of an application or to specific resources based on the user's role or other attributes.
