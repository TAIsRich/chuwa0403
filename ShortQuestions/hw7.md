Q2  
Set a breakpoint, start debugging, inspect variables and step through the code.

Q3  
DTO (Data Transfer Object): A DTO is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers of an application or between applications. It typically contains only the necessary fields and methods required to transfer the data, without any business logic or behavior. DTOs are commonly used in client-server communication, where the data needs to be serialized and deserialized.

VO (Value Object): A VO is similar to a DTO, but it typically contains more business logic or behavior. A VO is used to represent a value or concept, such as a date range, and can contain methods that operate on the value. VO is usually immutable and can be shared across different layers of the application.

Payload: A Payload is a term used in the context of data transmission over a network, and it refers to the data that is being sent. The Payload is the actual content of a message, which could be a DTO, VO, or any other type of data.

DO (Domain Object): A DO is a class that represents a business entity or concept in the domain model of an application. DOs typically contain both data and behavior, such as validation rules or business logic. DOs are used to encapsulate the business rules and logic of an application.

Model: The term "Model" can refer to different things in software development, depending on the context. It can refer to the representation of data or objects in an application, such as the object model or data model. It can also refer to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates an application into three components: the model, the view, and the controller. In this pattern, the model represents the data and business logic of an application, while the view represents the user interface and the controller mediates between the two.

Q4  
It is a Java annotation that is used to annotate a class field or method, to specify the JSON property name that should be used during serialization and deserialization of JSON data.

Q5  
Jackson is a popular Java library used for working with JSON data. It provides a set of Java classes for parsing JSON data, generating JSON data, and mapping between JSON data and Java objects. Jackson is widely used in Java web applications for handling JSON data.

Q6  
In a Spring Boot application, a starter is a set of pre-configured dependencies that are commonly used together for a specific purpose or feature. Spring Boot starters simplify the process of configuring and setting up a Spring Boot application by providing a set of commonly-used dependencies and pre-configured defaults.

Q7  
@RequestMapping is used to map HTTP requests to a controller method or class. The value attribute specifies the URL pattern to map the request to, and the method attribute specifies the HTTP method to handle.

Create (POST): @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST): This maps a POST request to the URL "/users", which is typically used for creating a new user.

Read (GET): @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET): This maps a GET request to the URL "/users/{id}", where {id} is the ID of the user to retrieve. This is typically used to retrieve a specific user or a list of users.

Update (PUT or PATCH): @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT) or @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PATCH): This maps a PUT or PATCH request to the URL "/users/{id}", where {id} is the ID of the user to update. This is typically used to update an existing user.

Delete (DELETE): @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE): This maps a DELETE request to the URL "/users/{id}", where {id} is the ID of the user to delete. This is typically used to delete an existing user.

Q8  
ResponseEntity is a class in the Spring Framework that represents an entire HTTP response, including the HTTP status code, headers, and body.

In Spring Web applications, controller methods typically return a ResponseEntity object instead of directly returning the response body content. This allows better control over the details of the HTTP response, such as the status code and headers.

Q9  
ResultSet is an interface in the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API that represents a set of results from a database query. It provides methods to iterate over the rows in the result set and retrieve the values of the columns.

Here is the general flow of how to get data using JDBC:

1. Load the JDBC driver: Before you can use JDBC to interact with a database, you need to load the appropriate JDBC driver for your database.

2. Open a connection: To connect to a database, you need to create a Connection object using the DriverManager.getConnection() method. You'll need to pass in the URL of the database, as well as any authentication information required.

3. Create a statement: To execute a query or update against the database, you need to create a Statement object using the Connection.createStatement() method.

4. Execute the query: To execute a query, you'll call one of the executeQuery() methods on your Statement object, passing in the SQL query string.

5. Iterate over the results: Once you've executed the query, you'll get a ResultSet object that contains the results of your query. You can iterate over the rows in the result set using the next() method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more rows in the result set. You can use the various getXXX() methods on the ResultSet object to retrieve the values of the columns.

6. Close the result set and statement: Once you're finished with the result set, you should close it using the ResultSet.close() method. Similarly, you should close the statement using the Statement.close() method.

7. Close the connection: Finally, when you're done interacting with the database, you should close the connection using the Connection.close() method.

Q10  
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that enables developers to map object-oriented programming concepts to relational databases. ORM frameworks provide a way to interact with a database using object-oriented programming concepts instead of raw SQL queries. ORM frameworks typically provide an abstraction layer that hides the underlying SQL details and exposes a set of APIs or methods for interacting with the database.

Q12  
Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form. In this serialized form, the data can be delivered to another data store (such as an in-memory computing platform), application, or some other destination.

The reverse process—constructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes—is deserialization. The deserialization process recreates the object, thus making the data easier to read and modify as a native structure in a programming language.

Q13  
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] numbers = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};

    double average = Arrays.stream(numbers)
        .average()
        .orElse(Double.NaN);

    System.out.println("Average: " + average);
  }
}
```
