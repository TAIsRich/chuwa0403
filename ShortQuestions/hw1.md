Maven is the tool that helps simplify the java application development process by managing dependencies, automating builds, plugin management and enhanced the project structure.

Maven usually has the following roles:
1. Manage Dependencies(Package). 
2. Build Project (Cycle)
3. Documentation
3. Reporting


## 10.

1. validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
2. compile - compile the source code of the project
3. test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
4. package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
5. verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
6. install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
7. deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

## 11. 
1. mvn package – take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
2. mvn install – install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
