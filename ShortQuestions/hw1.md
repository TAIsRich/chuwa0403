2. Commands learned

```
git commit
git pull
git push
git add
git init
git clone
git checkout
git branch
git stash
git stash pop
```



3. The basic steps to init a git repo in your local

```git
cd <target-directory>
git init
git add .
git commit -a -m "message"
git push
```



4.  Clone a repo from Github

- Open the GitHub website and navigate to the repository that you want to clone.

- Click on the "Code" button located on the right-hand side of the page.

- From the dropdown menu, select "HTTPS" to get the URL of the repository.

```
git clone <repository_url>
```



5. Create a new branch and checkout to that branch

```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```



6. Merge the branch_test to master branch

```
git checkout branch_test
git pull
git merge branch_test
git commit -a -m "merged to master branch"
git push
```



7. Stash new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you check out back to branch_learn_stash

```
git stash
git checkout <other_branch>
git chechout <branch_learn_stash>
git stash pop
```

IntelliJ:

- Make sure that you have made some changes to the code on the branch_learn_stash branch.

- Open the "Version Control" tool window in IntelliJ.

- Click on the "Local Changes" tab.

- Click on the "Stash" button at the top of the window to stash changes.

- Switch to a different branch using the "Git Branches" tool window.

- Switch back to the branch_learn_stash branch using the "Git Branches" tool window.

- Click on the "Stash" button again to view your stashes.

- Click on the "Apply" button next to the stash that you want to apply to the branch.



8. How to understand PR is based on branch

Pull request is used to merge changes from a branch into another. Usually, we merge a feature branch into master/main branch. When we use pull request, we need to specify the branch to be merged and the branch to merge into.



9. Maven's role and what it's used to do

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for java projects. Maven provides a easy way to download, add and remove the dependencies/libraries in a Java project.

Its roles include - manage dependencies, build project, documentation, reporting, etc.



10. Life cycle of Maven 

Clean -> prepare-resources -> validate -> package -> install

1. Clean Phase: This phase removes all the files generated by the previous build from the target directory. The "clean" phase is executed first in the Maven lifecycle.

2. Build Phase: This phase is the core of the Maven build lifecycle, and it is where the project is built, tested, and packaged. The "build" phase includes several sub-phases that are executed in a specific order:

   - Validate: This phase checks if the project is valid and all the necessary information is available to build it.

   - Compile: This phase compiles the source code of the project.

   - Test: This phase runs the tests that are included in the project.

   - Package: This phase creates an executable package of the project, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.

   - Integration-test: This phase runs the integration tests that require the built package to be deployed.

   - Verify: This phase verifies that the package is valid and meets the quality standards.

   - Install: This phase installs the package to the local repository.

   - Deploy: This phase deploys the package to a remote repository.

3. Site Phase: This phase generates a project website that includes documentation, reports, and other project-related information.



11. Difference between package and install in maven lifecycle

Package phase creates a distributable package of the project such as JAR, WAR, and EAR file. Install phase installs the package to the local repository on the developer's machine.



12. Plugins in maven

Plugins in maven are software components that provide additional functionality to the build process. They are used to extend the capabilities of Maven and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as generating documentation, running tests, deploying artifacts, and more.

Plugins in maven include - build, reporting, deployment, code generation, utility
