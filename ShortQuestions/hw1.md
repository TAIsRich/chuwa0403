Q9:  
Maven is essentially a project management tool that abstracts
the project development and management process into a project
model (POM).

Q10:  
The lifecycle of Maven is a series of phases that define the 
sequence of events and goals that are executed during a build process.  
mvnClean -> prepare-resources -> validate -> package -> install


Q11:  
The package phase creates a distributable package of the project, 
while the install phase creates a package and installs it into the 
local Maven repository, making it available for use as a dependency in other local projects.

Q12:  
In Maven, plugins are tools that can be used to perform a specific task or goal within a Maven build.  
For example, mvn compile, mvn clean.
