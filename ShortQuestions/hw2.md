## 2. Wrapper Class will convert primitive data types into objects. The objects are necessary if we wish to modify the arguments passed into the method (because primitive types are passed by value). The classes in java. util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes help in this case also

## 3. HashMap is non-syncronized and is not thread safe while HashTable is thread safe and is synchronized. HashMap allows one null key and values can be null whereas HashTable doesn't allow null key or value. HashMap is faster than HashTable. HashMap iterator is fail-safe where HashTable iterator is not fail-safe

## 4. String Pool in Java is a special storage space in Java Heap memory where string literals are stored. It is also known by the names - String Constant Pool or String Intern Pool. Whenever a string literal is created, the JVM first checks the String Constant Pool before creating a new String object corresponding to it.

## 5. Garbage collection in Java is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used. This automatically frees up memory space and ideally makes coding Java apps easier for developers.

## 6. Access modifiers are keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields, methods, and constructors in a class. The four access modifiers in Java are public, protected, default, and private.

## 7. ava final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value. If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

## 8. The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.

## 9. Overriding occurs when the method signature is the same in the superclass and the child class. Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Thanks for learning with the DigitalOcean Community.

## 10. The this() constructor refers to the current class object. The super() constructor refers immediate parent class object. It is used for invoking the current class method. It is used for invoking parent class methods.

## 11. A Java Class is stored in the form of byte code in a . class file after it is compiled. The ClassLoader loads the class of the Java program into memory when it is required. The ClassLoader is hierarchical and so if there is a request to load a class, it is delegated to the parent class loader.

## 12. In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method, depending on the type of object that is passed to the method. To put it simply, polymorphism in Java allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.

## 13. Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.

## 14. Interfaces are a kind of code contract, which must be implemented by a concrete class. Abstract classes are similar to normal classes, with the difference that they can include abstract methods, which are methods without a body. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

## 16. The Queue interface is present in java.util package and extends the Collection interface is used to hold the elements about to be processed in FIFO(First In First Out) order. It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to inserting elements at the end of the list and deleting elements from the start of the list, (i.e.), it follows the FIFO or the First-In-First-Out principle.
