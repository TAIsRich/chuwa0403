## 1. What is generic in Java? 

In Java, "generic" refers to a feature that allows you to **write reusable code that can work with different types of data**. Specifically, Java generics provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can take in or return values of a parameterized type.

By using generics, you can write more flexible and type-safe code, which can help you catch errors at compile time instead of runtime. For example, instead of writing a separate class or method for every data type, you can write a single generic class or method that can work with any data type.
